Create Deep Fake videos of Junta leadership to create confusion and desertions among Myanmar Army soldiers and their supporters,m6phyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/myanmar/comments/m6phyq/create_deep_fake_videos_of_junta_leadership_to/,157,40,1615946691.0,myanmar,0.98,Droiddiddy,2492,3281.5500925925926,"I keep coming up with crazy ideas!  We, Burmese Myanmar people, are at war with the JUNTA so I will do what I must from the US while my countrymen are being killed!  

So, the Junta leadership, Tatmadaw (Myanmar military), and their mouthpiece news outlets lost all of their verified FB accounts and pages.  They cannot issue official statements or live stream their propaganda through FB. Facebook is the defacto form of communication in Myanmar.  It is our internet.  40% of Myanmar population has a fb account in 2020.  

What if DEEP Fake videos of Junta chairman Min Aung Hlaing or vice chair Soe Win or Junta SPOX Zaw Min Tun are made telling their soldiers to stand down or defect and join CDM?  Or make a deep fake a video of MRTV or MWD TV news announcer pointing out the Junta's atrocities and urge soldiers to desert?  Even make one of the previous JUNTA chief Gen Than Shwe (Min Aung Hlaing's old boss who is very old, alive and healthy) denouncing the coup?  Share these videos on facebook and tatmadaw supporters fb groups (some of which I shared on another thread for you all to report).  

This will cause massive confusion since DEEP FAKE is a new phenomenon.  JUNTA has no way to counter it on facebook w/o their bluecheck accts.  They have to rely on analogue radio and TV and paper newspaper to announce that these are fake videos.  But facebook has ability to view these videos on demand.   these videos will spread like wildfire on Burmese facebook.  

Gotta keep fighting!  #Fightback!
