YEARS OF PROGRESS. THERE WERE ISSUES AGAIN AND AGAIN, BUT AT LEAST WE WERE MOVING FORWARD. Y'ALL SEE MYANMAR PLAZA? BEFORE THAT IT WAS ALL COLONIAL PLAZAS. WE HAVE 5 STAR AND LUXURY HOTELS.

FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK.   


What do we do now? What's going to happen? Is 8888 going to happen again? I was not alive for the uprising, but the effects of it still exist today.

What's the UN going to do? Write a letter with a 'pwease'? Shit wtf is the US going to do? We don't have enough oil. Are they going to commit war crimes here too? Who gives a shit if there is 'pressure from the foreign powers', it's never done anything before.

Holy shit, this is something that you hear about in movies with military generals calling martial law. I can't believe this is real. We're fucked."
