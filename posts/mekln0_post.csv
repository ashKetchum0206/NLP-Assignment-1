Oh my god! In the USA we hear nothing about what is going on in your country!,mekln0,https://www.reddit.com/r/myanmar/comments/mekln0/oh_my_god_in_the_usa_we_hear_nothing_about_what/,412,98,1616872857.0,myanmar,0.98,Trumpthulhu-Fhtagn,13801,2769.9523148148146,"I came here to ask a simple and innocent questions about your culture, and instead I am greeted with a nightmare horror-show of people being shot and beaten in the streets and bombings! 

I checked and our our major news outlets (FOX, CNN, etc,) maybe report on these terrible things once every two weeks, at the most.

I'm so sorry to see what a costly and terrible fight you are going through. I won't pretend to understand the politics, but I am pained to see the inhumanity. 

I hope your country heals soon."
