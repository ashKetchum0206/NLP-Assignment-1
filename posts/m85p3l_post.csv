How you can help people of Myanmar in their fight for freedom if you are in another country?,m85p3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/myanmar/comments/m85p3l/how_you_can_help_people_of_myanmar_in_their_fight/,1635,193,1616116079.0,myanmar,1.0,brocolliNcheese,17452,2554.0533333333333,"# What has happened and why?
On February 1 2021, the military in Myanmar, led by commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing, staged a coup and successfully overthrown the democratically elected government. As a country that was under harsh military dictatorship for five decades from 1962 to 2011, the brutality and numerous crimes committed by the military including genocides and war crimes are apparent in its history. The infamous coup leader, Min Aung Hlaing, is well known for multitude of crimes from systemic discrimination and human rights violations against minority groups to ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya people for which he has received international condemnation and sanctions.

After the coup and the detainment of several officials that were democratically elected by civilians, citizens of Myanmar began peaceful protests through out the country and participated in Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM). However, the armed forces have ruthlessly treated peaceful protestors and CDM participants with live ammunitions, arsons, abductions and unthinkable torture methods that eventually lead to tragic deaths. As depressing as it is, it is worth giving some examples of the abomination carried out by the inhumane armed forces:

* a pregnant woman was shot point-blank in the head for helping peaceful protestors hide in her house
* a medical student was killed for trying to save injured people on a city street
* [an activist was abducted and tortured to death by pouring acid or extremely hot-liquid into his mouth and possible disembowelment](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/15/the-death-of-zaw-myat-lynn-allegations-torture-used-on-opposition-activist-in-myanmar)
* [grave of a 19-year old protestor who was shot dead was secretely dugged up by the police causing more outrage and raising concens of a cover up](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/12/asia/myanmar-protester-angel-democracy-martyr-intl-hnk/index.html)

Over 200 people have been killed at the time of writing this and thousands of civilians have been illegally detained. The fallen heroes who had given their lives fighting for freedom are but not limited to politicians, doctors, monks, pregnant women and children.

The atrocities of the military keep increasing day by day and these crimes of utmost savagery have to stop. Despite these circumstances, Myanmar people continue to stand for their rights and freedom. The sacrifice of the fallen heroes must not go in vain.
