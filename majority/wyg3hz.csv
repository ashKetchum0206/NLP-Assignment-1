Its a like a student loan in the US, you can default on other commercial loans, but you can never default on your student loans, you have to pay it one way or another.

Mind you one conflict is basically a good old fashion war between 2 nations, the other is a low level civil war which doesnt attract the urgency of the US foreign policy doctrine.

You can't take one single variable say for example human rights to justify an intervention. It takes multitude of variables from geopolitics, energy security, trade volume, Polt ideology to account for to understand why the west intervene in some countries while they don't. Best example case study is Libya's case where even though it's a internal power struggle but why the west choose to intervene another case is Syria and the most infamous ones is Iraq. Plus, US and the west learned the lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan where it takes years, trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of local and thousands foreign lives to intervene but does it bring peace and proserity to those two countries?",3,2,1661577259.0,kirakyaw,negative,neutral,neutral,neutral

And the higher education act of 1976, both federal and private student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. they are caveats, but for the most part, no dice, your still saddled with student loans till you pay it off.
