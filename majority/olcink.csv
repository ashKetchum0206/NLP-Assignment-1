t3_olcink,h5dkzsq,"Really? 

Do you know why ASEAN invited MAL to the summit and why there is no ASEAN envoy in Myanmar? 

Like it or not, MAL is in power of Myanmar, he and his regime might not be the legitimate Govt of Myanmar but they are the ones in control and the ones with the guns and doing majority of the killing. If ASEAN don't talk to them, who should ASEAN talk to? 

Granted that what was discussed and agreed on during the ASEAN Summit, MAL didn't follow. 

As for the ASEAN Envoy, the Myanmar Govt must agreed and give permission first before the Special Envoy can enter sovereign Myanmar.

So stop blaming others for your own problems.

t1_h5dkzsq,h5ekffh,"Oh please do tell us, what has the ASEAN summit accomplished? Has Min Aung Hlaing's ""government"" adhered to the five points? Have the killings stopped? Have arbitrary arrests and torture ended? Has the civilian government been released? Has the junta softened its language at all?

The answer to all the questions above is a resounding no. Instead, many in Myanmar continue to die whether they are directly killed by the military or they die by COVID. The Tatmadaw have shown no signs that they will change course. ASEAN cannot even agree to a special envoy. Meanwhile, the ASEAN summit and other ASEAN meetings are broadcast in trash outlets like the Global New Light of Myanmar to show that the regime has international legitimacy. The situation in Myanmar is more worse now than ever.

What ASEAN does matters a lot. What the international community does in fact matter a lot even if you like to pretend it doesn't. The more the international community meets with the SAC as if they are the legitimate government, the more the regime becomes convinced of they can keep power. The more lower level regime officials become convinced that abandoning their posts is pointless even if they are against the junta as they feel they are in a losing battle. The more license to commit further impunity is given to the Tatmadaw. 

And decisions by international actors by the way has been vital in uprisings in various points in history. The American Revolution received extensive support from the French. One of the reasons the regime in Iran gave up is the United States was no longer willing to support the Shah whole heartedly. A large reason the Revolutions of 1989 were able to happen is because of the Soviet Union's decline and reforms which released the Soviet's stranglehold over much of Central and Eastern Europe. 

Oh, and regarding your point about Marcos and Suharto, those are not even that applicable to Myanmar. Marcos' regime was not a military junta and the security forces completely abandoned Marcos after largely non-violent protests. The generals of Indonesia were willing to embrace civilian rule and Suharto had outlived his usefulness. Meanwhile, the Tatmadaw is far more of a ubiquitous institution that is not based around single figures. That is why they keep producing figures like Ne Win, Saw Maung, Than Shwe, Thein Sein and now Ming Aung Hlaing. It is significantly much more difficult to uproot this style of regime because of that.

And the reason the ""Keyboard Warriors"" are downvoting your post is because you repeatedly are condescending and patronizing to the people of Myanmar. You feel it is your duty to ""educate"" people here in a paternalistic way because you are convinced about your own intellectual superiority.

t1_h5ekffh,h5en7ly,"When did in any of my comment said that the ASEAN summit was successful?

And yes MAL did not bother to follow the 5 points.

My point is that there is not going to be any outside help coming at all especially when we are in a worldwide pandemic. If any outside help is to come, it would had came long ago.

I never claimed to be intelligent or anything like that. You and I can know that no help is coming and yes unfortunately the Burmese are on their own.

You mentioned about the American Revolution, I am sure that you are aware that French had colonies in the US too back then and their rivalry with Britain goes back before the American Revolution even started. The French involvement was very little, they did send some troops, equipment and advisors.

Does a foreign nation have such a rivalry with the Tatmadaw now? 

You mentioned Suharto and Marcos, key is to win some of the leading officers under the dictator.

Likewise, you are ignorant of how the World works.

UN is set up to try to prevent WW3 from happening. It is not set up to deal with genocide or regimes although it tried on several occasions is. ASEAN is more for economy growth and cooperation among its members. They have no right to interfere into another member's domestic issue. These 2 organisations can only issue statements and at most impose sanctions. Thats what they will do. ASEAN will never send a Coalition force into Myanmar. UN cannot deploy its peacekeeping troops without the approval of all its UNSC Council members which include both China and Russia.

Blaming/scolding/flaming UN or ASEAN or any other foreign nations does not solve the current situation. It will just make them turn their backs on Myanmar.

t1_h5en7ly,h5epv6r,"""Help"" doesn't have to come at the barrel of the gun. It also comes from diplomatic support and recognition as I talked about. Something that the ASEAN summit and current engagement has backfired horribly with. The problem is that you repeatedly downplay ASEAN's complicity in giving the Tatmadaw legitimacy. Denying diplomatic legitimacy does hurt the Tatmadaw's standing. Otherwise they would not be obsessed with getting reporters to stop referring to them as a junta nor would they be be so eager to post pictures and videos of meetings with ASEAN, Russia and China. The fact is that ASEAN has been a terrible ally to Myanmar and diplomatic pressure would certainly help weaken the regime. 

The problem is you feel the urge to repeatedly browbeat Burmese people from a position of immense privilege as if you are telling them something they don't already know. They know the situation far better than you and I do. People are continuing to resist however they can whether it is joining an armed group, raising donations, going on strike, raising awareness on social media or even making silly memes like OP is doing for morale purposes. And people have actually tried to reach out to soldiers and police, but it has had only limited success for various reasons.  Your attempts to ""educate"" people here is not helping at all. It is not really a shock you are met with hostility here acting like you are enlightening people here when there is a good chance a lot of the local Myanmar people here actually have friends and family that have disappeared, have been forced into hiding or died of COVID. 

There is still a ton the international community can Do. Sanctions against the MOGE by the US and EU can be put into place to deprive the junta of millions of dollars in foreign currency reserves. Governments can recognize the NUG as the legitimate government of Myanmar, weakening the regime's diplomatic standing. ASEAN countries like the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia that are more sympathetic to the anti-junta resistance can take much harsher stances against the junta that might firce ASEAN's hand to harden its own pressure. 

The world's hands are only tied if you subscribe to the defeatist mentality you repeatedly parrot on here. It does not help the people of Myanmar at all. 

Edit: I would strongly suggest you read [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/28/world/asia/myanmar-army-protests.html) to get an idea why convincing the army to turn on the upper echelons of the regime is significantly more difficult than in the Philippines or even Indonesia.

And are you implying that Myanmar social media saying mean things about the UN or ASEAN is why the international media is covering Myanmar less and less? You are joking right? The international media always does this when situations drag on like this as new headlines arise and other stories get hit into the backburner. Mainstream media is still putting out good articles about Myanmar, they just don't get the attention they receive in favor of other more ""exciting"" stories.

t1_h5epv6r,h5ero9q,"Didn't ASEAN tried to help thru diplomatic means? But unfortunately MAL did not follow the 5 points as recommended by ASEAN.

If ASEAN don't talk to MAL first then talk to who? The NUG? 

The ones in power is the Tatmadaw regardless if they are or are not the legitimate Govt of Myanmar. They are the ones holding the guns, tanks, etc and also the ones that is doing the killings. They are the ones in control of majority of Myanmar. If they don't agreed to a ceasefire, what is the point of talking to NUG? NUG is exiled somewhere in India and does not hold much or any provinces in Myanmar. Although they are recognised as the legitimate by majority of the Burmese, but no nations have recognised them as the Govt of Myanmar.

t1_h5ero9q,h5ev8lp,"The problem is ASEAN engagement is it was doomed to fail and people knew this way before the ill fated ASEAN summit. In fact, it only seemed to have legitimized the regime further which is what this meme is poking fun at. The reason why Myanmar people continue to express anger at the UN and ASEAN is because neither body has done enough for Myanmar. Will the anger do anything? You are right it will not. But people need to vent to let out their anger as a coping mechanism. In these horrible times, people will do whatever they have to do to get them through the day.

Regarding NUG recognition, the NUG may not control territory, but as you point out, they have the support of the majority of Myanmar. And that means something. As I have talked about in my other posts, international acceptance is something the junta craves and why they hired a lobbyist to try to whitewash their image abroad (which that plan has since failed due to sanctions). Recognition of the NUG deprives them of that legitimacy and can potentially free up frozen government assets that could be directed to the NUG. These actions alone won't topple the Tatmadaw, but it certainly will make it closer to a reality.

I apologize for my belligerent nature in my posts. But the reason why I come across that way is because I have lived in the country for several years and people that are like family there. People need all the support they can get both domestically and internationally and I don't think you are being helpful. Please take time to consider what I have said and what Myanmar people are saying. 

Also, regarding the American Revolution, French support is widely understood to be quite helpful to the efforts of the colonies.

To be frank, ASEAN had done much more than they did before. 

No one owes it to the Burmese or anyone in the World to come to their assistance.

Let's say you are in debt and need $1000 from a group of friends, this group of friends pool whatever they can spare but only came out with $200. You keep complaining to others that's this group of friends are not helpful enough, one fine day, this group of friends might just turned their back on you. Help you, you also complain, help you not up to your expectations, you also complain. You get my drift?

It will take a long time if NUG is to be recognised by other nations as the legitimate Govt of Myanmar. Taiwan has been trying to be recognised as a nation since after WW2 and until now, only a few nations recognised them as independent country and have diplomatic ties with them.

It I not that I don't support the Burmese people. Since you and I know and I pretty sure that they know that such meme condemning the UN or ASEAN are practically useless and that they are mostly on their own, they should direct their energy to get an alternative plan.

We are in 2020s and not the 1700s, French did help the Americans in their revolution against the British by supplying arms and even some troops but the majority of the fighting were done by the Americans. 

US did supply arms to the Talibans in Afghanistan when the Soviet Union invaded it and look how and what the Talibans eventually evolved into.

US tried to intervene in Vietnam from the 1960s to mid 1970s, what happened? US has the superior weaponry but still got their arse kicked. 

What did US involvements in Iraq, Syria and recently Afghanistan became? 

Did the sanctions and embargo worked in previous attempts on Myanmar? Did these sanctions and embargo work in Cuba or North Korea?
