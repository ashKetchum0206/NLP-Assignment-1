t3_qtl3vr,hklvgxr,I just hope that the PDF is well trained with these weapons so that they can use them effectively against their adversaries. I wish them all the luck in the world,18,0,1636909576.0,plutonium_67,positive,positive,positive,positive

t3_qtl3vr,hkneica,Ok as an American who has been following the conflict I have been noticing a lot of pics of the PDF with what seem to be guns sourced from the US civilian market. The first picture both of the rifles look like the ARs you would commonly find on the civilian market in the US. Like I am almost certain the guys rifle on the left is a palmetto state armory AR-15. The second photo is hard to see the writing but that optic looks a lot like one sold by primary arms in the US. The third photo the guy is very clearly holding a ruger precision rifle which is common in the US as a budget precision rifle. Usually when the US government supplies forces clandestinely they use guns that would be commonly found in the region so my best guess is some absolutely chads are risking prison sentences to get the PDF guns. The suppressors all look like they have been made there.,13,0,1636930961.0,Brown_boog_boy,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

t1_hkkqwc9,hknczwn,"Ok so that’s the weirdest one for me. It looks very similar to a JDJ custom rifle that’s made in the states. They aren’t designed for any military application and the ammo is made from cast lead so not very conducive to armor penetration , they guy who runs the company just wanted to make a really big ass gun. That plus all the scopes, mags, and modern ARs these guys are using makes me assume someone in the states is probably helping supply them.",3,1,1636930302.0,Brown_boog_boy,negative,negative,neutral,negative

I always thought that APC would have about the same layer of armour as a tank.

t1_hkl9cof,hklei3c,"Your thinking has merit! Back in WW2 they used anti-tank guns throughout, but by 1941/2 they were largely obsolete in anti-tank roles. Now their only use is penetrating thin-skinned vehicles. For example in Iraq ISIS was able to penetrate Humvees and in Syria the various groups use them against HMG emplacements and soft-skinned vehicles.

Basically the best employment of these guns would be to hit APCs from the side or to disable trucks.",3,4,1636902208.0,Woofers_MacBarkFloof,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
