We have learned our lessons in Vietnam and the middle east, it is none of our  business to go and die on the complete other side of the world just because bad things are happening.

Ready for the downvotes, but seriously. Every single time the United States intervenes in a situation like this, all that happens is tons of naive young american soldiers go and die and kill in a place they didn't even know existed before getting blasted by the world for trying to play world police.

What I'm saying is that just blocking the streets without any planning ahead, without any means to defend yourself, etc, is just signing your own death wish. Those terrorists are able and will kill each and every single one that stands in their way.

It is bravery, but it's not worth it if the people living there will all get slaughtered in a night for doing that, without being able to fight back.

At least my point of view, having to admit, made from my cozy home. Block the streets when you're ready to fight them off, when you can actually achieve something by doing that.",12,3,1616000371.0,None,negative,negative,negative,negative
