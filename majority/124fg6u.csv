t1_je0wvz6,je0z52r,"Yeah the cold war is a big part of it too, a big reason dictators are replaced with dictators are the actions take by the us and ussr. You have a soviet friendly leader, CIA kills him and replaced with a a junta. Got a US friendly leader, send in the KGB and replace them with a Soviet friendly one. Its unfair to say violent revolution doesnt work by its nature when a big part of why it doesnt work are powerful countries making sure its so. “They replace them with another” only makes sense if “they” are the powerful countries with an interest in instating a tyrant with friendly foreign policy(to their state).
