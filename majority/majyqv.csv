No, believe me: The empathy is there. I just don't use it, since it's not helpful. And my understanding is there, too. I know how it feels seeing kids die. Been there, witnessed it.

> you are however insensitive or perceived as such.

This is more like it, especially the latter is true.

If you want my personal opinion: It's a shame and a tragedy what happens down there and that boy is just the last victim of the world not acting. Dozens of countries play world police today, ""bringing democracy and peace"". That's nothing but bullshit and bigotry. If that was the case, a joint task force of the UK, US and half the EU would have intervened already, with or without UN backing. But there's no gain for them there, Myanmar isn't sexy for their markets and economy. So in short: That poor boy died because the western world decided he is not worth rescuing. And that's the real problem here. That's why those people need to learn to fight themselves and believe me: The day they find the means and massacre each and every member of the military dictatorship will be a fucking good day.

But hey, I can't say that in public since it's not politically correct and condones the killing, the torture and the mutilation of humans. See now why I usually renounce from writing my personal opinion?

How about elaborating something believable and not more vague ""I'd attack the enemy of course and then I would win"" bullshit. Actual plan for the people in Myanmar, since apparently you know it can be done. ""...  plan on a coordinated attract (I assume autocorrect typo here) of the enemies support stations. The ones with weapons and ammo. To get as much weapons as possible. Then, kill them and their families with those weapons..."" So like D-Day with no weapons on the attacking side?

You literally said you know your share of revolutions and know what it's like to be shot (the being shot part I can believe, and maybe you've seen combat, but do you know actual revolution?)

If you didn't mean that you'd actually been through any or know it intimately, which is very strongly the implication with ""I know my share of revolutions"" then your statements on the entire topic are completely irrelevant all around. You can't make the claim that you know what it's like to go through what Myanmar is undergoing and then switch gears over halfway through and expect people to take you seriously. I'm legitimately curious what the ideas you're refusing to explain are.

Have you seen combat? I wouldn't doubt it. Have you seen combat from the point of view of a mass of unarmed civilians, though? I doubt that, very much so.
