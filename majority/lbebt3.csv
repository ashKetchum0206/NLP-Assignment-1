Everyone, the world, The UN, ASEAN etc., failed with Myanmar, currently and in the past. You can say our problems are our own, but the reality of the military regime having non-domestic weapons of war, trading our resources to ALL other nations etc., ethically places the blame on a complacent world that was taking advantage of the situation while hypocritically browbeating the old military regimes ineffectively, and undermining the current regime for its lack of condemnation for the military. The same military that they've empowered and ignored. They didn't get their HKG3s in 1988 out of thin air. They didn't get the MIGS from nothing. There are made in Myanmar clothes and items that are sold in North American markets. Kirin Beer has been shown to be working with the military.. and the list goes on and on. Total Oil and UNOCOL were complicit in the slavery of the Burmese people to build oil pipelines etc.,  


Then when their oppression hits a highlighted minority as with the Rohingya, they portray Myanmar as some type of democracy gone wrong, when any actual research would show the civilians and the democratic government (as you stated) has no actual power and no actual weapons. Yet luminaries like you, say they may have deserved this and all the Burmese deserve this.. because this is the government we ask for.  


Have you lived a day here? Even as an outsider you will see that this country has absolutely no freedom for their citizen. Yes you can walk around, it seems open etc., but the moment you are reported for saying the wrong thing, posting the wrong content, being in the wrong place etc., you can have those freedoms and your life taken away. Yet despite this there is still non violent protests and resistance; those people despite being poor, oppressed and knowing they might be hurt or killed, still go on. You are saying those people deserve this?  


The worst thing about this, the thing I keep restating and is ignored by armchair philosophers like you is this  


1.) The military has absolute power. The NLD/Civilian democratic government does want to curb their power, but cannot provoke them as they fear they will coup.  
2.) Despite the military created and unfair constitution of 2008 in which the army retains power, the democratic government has made inroads into reducing their power, which makes them worry. As such, they decided to do brutal clearance operations on the Rohingya, with a mostly indifferent and fearful public, with the goal of making the civilian government look bad. They succeed, and they world, like you paint our entire race as genocidal monsters, while ignoring history and facts. It's easy to make it a black and white buddhists vs muslim race war instead of the reality of another series of atrocities committed by the Burmese army.  
3.) Army takes coup. Armchair philosophers cheer then on, as if its some type of karmic victory or revenge for the Rohingya; thus proving you have no idea how Karma or reality works.",22,1,1612326275.0,drbkt,negative,negative,negative,negative

indifferent towards murders. So yes: you are ""entire race as genocidal monsters"" or at least complicit to them.

Burma can never advance without resolving the longest running civil war. Wars are not solved with endless ceasefires and talks, and such. Wars end by either one side winning or all sides fought to utter exhaustion: people die, children don't come back, people starve, etc ... Burma hasn't been allowed to get to that point.

Regarding the genocide, somehow or others there was never a big genocide of the Rohingya before the civilian government was allowed to have some powers. What's the motive of the military only to do it then? To discredit the civilian government and take back powers? They always could have taken powers back, we saw it happened.

The reason it happened must be that the military was doing the majority's popular wills to garner popularity but then it backfired. The military was more unpopular than ever, so they say, enough is enough, and attempt to crush everyone, from ASSK to the majority civilian.

This is a situation where everyone is trying to be duplicitous and playing 5D chess against one another. Only one thing historically has been shown to work: one side completely crushing others. Disbanding the Tatmadaw and handing tons of weapons to the majority, many of which still habour deep hatred and divisions towards the Rohingyas and what not may instead unleash even greater horrors. That's the story of the Balkans. As many says ""people don't care when it doesn't affect them"". What if when the Tatmadaw is gone, a small minority in the majority picks up the weapons and continue. They don't care, right?

They didn't protest the killings or defended the killings: ""oh some of them are not Burmese, they don't speak Burmese, they are actually Bangladeshi, this is Burma's internal domestic politics, this is counter-terrorism, what about the Burmese policemen they killed, etc ..."", I've heard all the excuses.

>You are misinforming and twisting it to look like a religious case.

my bad, it was an *ethnic* case.

>Because of nazi every single german were nazi? Because of facist every single japanese were facist?

Sort of. Most Germans and Japanese benefited from the wars, destructions, and looting when their countries was on the ascendancy and winning. Most didn't complain that much and were complicit. They worked in industries and sectors that in one way or another contributed to the war. They paid their price when they were being bombed to dust by the Allied airforces or raped en masse by the Red Army. Still, many of them escaped punishment. At the very least the entire officer and NCO corps should have been shot and were most government employees who worked in those governments before the war started and stayed on until the end. Most of the guilty are now dead and by and large subsequent generations of Germans and Japanese gave to the world and atoned for the sins, so I'm OK with modern Germans and Japanese. Not modern Burmese complicits.

In any case, the reason for Myanmar poverty is rather simple. Its main exports are natural gas, wood products, pulses, beans, fish, rice, clothing, jade and gems. These things can be easily harvested by expendable workers and/or foreign companies.
