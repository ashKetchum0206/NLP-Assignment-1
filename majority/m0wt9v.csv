(Taken from Wikipedia Rohingya People)
     The Rohingya maintain they are indigenous to western Myanmar with a heritage of over a millennium and influence from the Arabs, Mughals and Portuguese. The community claims it is descended from people in precolonial Arakan and colonial Arakan; historically, the region was an independent kingdom between Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The Myanmar government considers the Rohingya as colonial and postcolonial migrants from neighbouring Chittagong/East Bengal respectively Bangladesh. 
     It argues that a distinct precolonial Muslim population recognized as KAMAN, and that the Rohingya CONFLATE their history with the history of ARAKAN MUSLIMS in general to advance a separatist agenda. In addition, Myanmar's government does not recognise the term ""Rohingya"" .",1,5,1615474277.0,None,negative,negative,negative,negative
