t3_lj12nm,gn7vv3p,The military is doing a systematic campaign against his own people. It is like khmer rouge genocide. We need to do something. What else can we do to protect ourselves and get rid of this oppression and misery?,32,0,1613226510.0,Zach-ziyaon,negative,negative,negative,negative

I'm not willing to post the details publicly here as it will raise some flags within the military. If you DM me I can give you details, though I warn you it sounds fantastic/unbelievable.

t3_lj12nm,gnabc72,I’d heard firsthand that this drug was used in the 80’s from a boy who left. So I believe that the military has implemented its use again.

If you are spreading awareness, that's doing a lot for people here. We surely need UN involvement like investigation teams to get more countries involved in forcing this military out of power in unison.

t1_gnedt32,gnesm7c,"So to distract yourself from the horrible deaths of 750k of your fellow Europeans, you want to avert your eyes and look at political unrest with a very complex political scene that is much bigger and grayer than ""democracy = good, dictator = bad"", in a small Asian country halfway around the world, that so far fewer than a handful of people died?

Myanmar is unimportant in the grand scheme of things. Don't buy into the grand talk of ""if democracy fails here, it will fail elsewhere"" that Burmese talk about. That's bunk ""Domino theory"". It didn't happen in Vietnam, it wouldn't in Myanmar. Myanmar coup is not threat to global democracy. If you are European, threats to European democracy are much closer to home: it's Erdogan in Turkey (he's Islamising Turkey), Marine le Pen in France, Alternative für Deutschland in Deutschland, whatever that's going on in Poland, or Viktor Mihály Orbán in Hungary (and that's a bunch of fascists). There, I gave you a lot more to look at than COVID or Trump. Even better, all of them are in NATO or EU or both, meaning you actually can do something about them.

If you want to say something or other about ""pushing back China"", please remember that the EU is signing a free trade agreement with China and the EU appears to want to sit own the New Cold War.

So why should you bother about Myanmar? Let the Burmese deal with their country and the South East Asians would need to care about Myanmar first, before Europeans.",0,3,1613313821.0,None,negative,negative,negative,negative

I happen to live in a country with very, very low COVID cases and have family still living in a South East Asia country also with very, very low COVID numbers and some ties to Myanmar. Of course we have to care about Myanmar. If the US, EU, and ten different other things start to jump in because ""China"", Myanmar will be the first proxy war of the New Cold War. We don't want such mess spill over borders and hordes of refugees crossing the borders. Europe nearly imploded with some refugees crossing the Mediterranean.

So, I can have both the spare attention thanks to tremendous efforts to control COVID and we actually have a strategic concern about Myanmar.",1,5,1613337678.0,None,neutral,negative,neutral,neutral
