t3_mgbyxr,gsszs2e,"If the west stands by any longer, like they did with the genocide of Rohingya and Xinjiang and Tibet they are sending the CCP and Tatmadaw a very clear message. They have faced no consequences for South China Sea, covid19 or support for Tatmadae genocide. With every crime against humanity or breach of international laws they face no meaningful repercussions. This only emboldens them to commit more atrocities. WTF is going on when NATO and Allies are spending a $$$ trillion annually on military equipment and the CCP are bulldozing democracy across the planet

t3_mgbyxr,gsstlnf,"These protesters are the Burmese people that I learn to respect a lot.

However, those that keep spamming, whining, demanding, even flaming and scolding others on the likes of CNA FB or U.S. Navy FB when they replied with comments of telling them not to spam.

These Burmese keep posting copy and paste comments like Save Myanmar, We need R2P, We welcome US troops into Myanmar, we want airstrike on the military bases, etc. 

Other people will see these as spams and the posters being an irritating person and a nuisance. They will also view Burmese people as weak and pathetic.

All these will make others feeling less sympathic towards your sufferings and cause. 

It is totally fine to ask for help but so it at the right channels. Posting at CNA or US Navy FB will not get the attention of the World's leaders or UN. 

Let's be honest, no foreign nations will be deploying their troops into Myanmar to fight the Burmese military. There is little to gain and more to lose by deploying troops into Myanmar. 

UN cannot deploy because of various reasons like China and Russia will veto against deployment. India and Vietnam are also against the idea.

Many protesters died in the protest in 88 or 07, no nations send their troops back then, same as now. 

The Burmese people can either live on their knees under military rule or stand up on your feet and fight and even possibly even die for your democracy and freedom.

The choice is for the Burmese people to make.",4,0,1617112376.0,Dumas1108,negative,negative,negative,negative

t1_gstha4k,gstroue,"She had a Tatmadaw gun at her head. Also she was disqualified from being Prime Minister at the elections because Tatmadaw past a law that it was illegal because she had a foreign husband. So she was through a loophole instated in to the government as a state councillor not PM. A government where you had to gain a 75% majority to pass a motion and the Tatmadaw Junta comprised of 75% . She made a deal with the devil and indeed was very naive. If she had said anything that compromised the junta regarding the Rohingya she would if been back in prison long before February. So indeed many people believe she supported the genocide. Personally I don't believe this is the case despite what she said to UN reps and stuff that was reported in TV and other media outlets. She also could not support Muslims at this time because of the Buddhist Nationalism which in Myanmar is very strong even amoungst her supporters and could not be seen to support Muslims if she wanted to win the election

So now, do you relize that she was not the Prime Minister and did not support the genocide although I'll give you that she was publicly forced to defend the atrocities committed by the Tatmadaw. Naively ti keep her democratic dreams alive. Kind of foolish really considering where she is now.

. PLA supplied chemicals to produce meth and also traded for gold, jade and rubys. They sold  drugs to gain hard currency from  US and it's allies around the world and undermine democratic societies. Much like how North Korea were doing.

Today it's obvious that CCP want to stay on good terms with militias in Shan state where they have many business interests, built airports and is a major BRI corridor. PLA supply weapons in return to protect it's interests. As they are doing with the Arakun in Rakhine to protect PLA defacto naval base being developed. Not to mention the oil pipeline that runs through both states and reduces CCP reliance on Mallaca Strait.

CCP are using divisive tactics straight out the Trotsky manual to create ethnic tensions, which they are doing right across the globe right now. Divide and conquer tactics from Sun Tzu's ""The Art Of War"" and "" Unrestricted Warfare"" written by 2 PLA generals in the 70s just after Nixon met Mao.

It seems CCP want to keep Myanmar in a perpetual state of conflict, weakening all sides involved making them vulnerable to further political and economic coercion more reliant on PLA arms. While CCP make huge profits selling weapons to all sides.

What I can't understand is that if the Tatmadaw are aware that PLA are supplying weapons to them and also their enemies why are they allowing  CCP to Build the BRI and have so many business interests in Myanmar. They even had PLA reps at the Tatmadaw military parade recently even though they  know PLA are supplying arms to  militias to fight the Junta.

I'm guessing that CCP want everyone in Myanmar to fight each other while they make $$$billions selling ammo to all sides. Once every side is destroyed or on its knees PLA will move in under the guise of UN peacekeepers and get the threat of democracy and western influence away from Chinas doorstep. It's concerning that CCP have recently passed the Military Civilian Fusion Law and given PLA the mandate to protect CCP interests overseas just in the last few months.

Even though India is a democratic nation, I imagine they will show more support for the Tatmadaw to lessen the threat from separatists in NE India and also continue with development of projects by Indian companies like Adani mines and infrastructure like ports. 

I assumed it was the Wa that were mainly responsible for arms distribution between the main ethnic factions. Who is going to supply weapons to the 100,000 NDL that are planning to take up arms in a coalition with ethnic militias? As I can't see this organisation being very popular with CCP. 

Anyway thats my take on the situation at the moment. Please correct me if Im wrong. Anymore information would be appreciated.",1,5,1617192362.0,Significant-Day945,neutral,negative,negative,negative
