Besides which Burma is dominated by American culture.  

I look forward you you enjoying the view of a Trump hotel in Yangon.  The Donald likes to buy distressed  property of which there will be plenty after the junta falls.

/u/drbkt - since you replied to my comment and then temp banned me, basically taking the coward’s way out, I will edit the comment that offends you and tag you so you can read it.  You are an abusive and cowardly moderator.  

> First of all, I said world governments not comparing singular leaders, but the hypocrisy of party leadership. 

Governments are made up of people. They are not things.  I don’t know what your point is. 


> Secondly, every head of state is responsible for the failure of not just that current administration but the failures of past administrations, 

What a bizarre statement.  That is like saying the current government of France is responsible for excesses of the French Revolution and the absolute monarchy that preceded it.  

> so yes, we are all under different legacies of mass murders through incompetence, malice or just the ""normal"" course of history.

Agreed. 

> Secondly, take your Donald Trump loving BS elsewhere please and stay on topic. 

You brought that person  into the conversation not me.  

Some world leaders are polarizing. Assuming you like ASSK would you defend her in another forum where she was trashed or refrain in order to “stay on topic”

I’ve been banned elsewhere for defending ASSK and the pretext was I was denying Rohingya genocide.  You are of a similar ilk it seems.  

> I lived in Canada, my decision to move to Myanmar because the bipartisan idiocy of American politics is a personal decision, so if you want to further extrapolate on that than you can do so in many many other on topic forums. I even wrote that that was my personal discussion and not to trigger anyone to avoid this bullshit.

Fair enough. But your comment wasn’t about “bipartisan” idiocy in the USA (and btw Canada has that too, and don’t bother to tell me otherwise.  I’ve been a Canadian longer than you’ve lived in Canada).  

> Lastly, I'm pretty sick of your **** frankly, 

The feeling is mutual. 

> so if you want to troll me you can do so from some other sub. 

No thanks you aren’t worth it.  

> I've had a personal injury recently with all this **** happening here, 

I am sorry to hear that. My disgust at the violence the junta has committed against your country and your people is what caused me to post more here. 

I wish you better health 

> so my patience is thin. 

Noted.  

> You want to be unbanned, 

What gave you that idea?

I can see that my contributions here are no longer welcome. 

You can make it a permanent ban as I won’t be posting in this forum again.  I will continue to be active to help your country.

I am doing a and keep doing lots of shit, gonna keep doing till i die , but i don't need to advertise it.

\>  who fought their hardest against Germany while asking op to not run

I think wrong universe and wrong timeline , in this timeline , lets look back history , ah yesss ,  this is what french did :

\> World War II - A decisive defeat even by French standards. Hitler and the German Youth spend Christmas time sleeping soundly through the winter, then arouse themselves to conquer France in six weeks. Hitler dances in front of the Eiffel Tower, while the French command staff retreats to Algeria to institute a crash language program to teach French privates how to say ""I surrender"" in German and French generals to say ""We surrender"" in German. Conquered French liberated by the United States and Britain just as they finish learning the Horst Wessel Song and some small portion of the German work ethic. De Gaulle of it al

t1_hh86lsb,hh87kvu,"First of all, I said world governments not comparing singular leaders, but the hypocrisy of party leadership. Secondly, every head of state is responsible for the failure of not just that current administration but the failures of past administrations, so yes, we are all under different legacies of mass murders through incompetence, malice or just the ""normal"" course of history.  


Secondly, take your Donald Trump loving BS elsewhere please and stay on topic. I lived in Canada, my decision to move to Myanmar because the bipartisan idiocy of American politics is a personal decision, so if you want to further extrapolate on that than you can do so in many many other on topic forums. I even wrote that that was my personal discussion and not to trigger anyone to avoid this bullshit.

Lastly, I'm pretty sick of your bullshit frankly, so if you want to troll me you can do so from some other sub. I've had a personal injury recently with all this shit happening here, so my patience is thin. You want to be unbanned, you can ask a mod who is not as sick of your passive aggressive condescending masturbatory comments in the guise of discussion.",1,9,1634648477.0,drbkt,negative,negative,negative,negative
t1_hh86lsb,hj89knt,"Nice play of the victim card.

  
Exact statement for which you were banned ""I look forward you you enjoying the view of a Trump hotel in Yangon. The Donald likes to buy distressed property of which there will be plenty after the junta falls.""  


Pretty sure you brought this irrelevant bs in with your initial comment, but hey self reflection or even admission of what you wrote is not your fore.  


As for me being a coward, I stand by what I said. Again to reiterate you weren't banned because of your opinion, but because of you bringing your pro trump BS as while rejoicing in our decline. Frankly that was not your first post pretending solidarity while crapping on us. But again, you were banned (temp) for off topic. If you don't want to come back that is up to you. But you are not fooling anyone with the victim card and the passive aggressive reply. That only serves to highlight your ignorance.

> I'm going to take my ball and go home!
I want to be in control of the situation and if I can't then no one is going to be allowed to be happy about the outcome.

> The expression comes from the playground where one kid, the one who owns the soccer ball or basket ball, doesn't get his way in the game. If he doesn't get his way then he gets mad and punishes those who are unwilling to accept his mandate. He does this my taking his ball and going home thus ending the game and any fun the participants were having.

> The expression ""I'm going to take my ball and go home"" when directed at an individual is used to illustrate the individual's immaturity when that person can't get his way and no longer wants to be a participant in the conversation or a contributor to solving a problem.",1,1,1635994230.0,iranisculpable,neutral,neutral,negative,neutral
