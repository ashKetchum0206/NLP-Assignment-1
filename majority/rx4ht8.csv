t1_hrlf742,hrlo3k4,I think most of the arms China has given to the northern groups are things like type 81 rifles. Norinco does make knockoff m4s but pretty much all the m4/m16s I have seen in photos look to be American made so they are probably from Thailand. There are also a ton of old m16s that the government issued to police it seems. The stuff that really makes it look like someone in the states is smuggling guns to the PDF where the photos that came out that looked like PSA rifles ( budget American brand that is not exported) and Ruger precision rifles in the hands of the PDF.

The M4 is extensively used by the United States Armed Forces and is largely replacing the M16 rifle in United States Army and United States Marine Corps (USMC) combat units as the primary infantry weapon and service rifle.

At first glance the barrel looks a little bit long to be an actual M4 but I could be wrong. Another tell is that for it to be an m4 their will be a little cutout on the barrel  in front of the front sight so it can mount a m203.
