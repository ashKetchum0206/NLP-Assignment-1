To see the entire country going against the Junta just made me feel so encouraged to keep on fighting, and then not even a month later the military started cracking down on the protesters. Keep in mind, all the protests were peaceful, there was NO violence at all. Yes, people were insulting MAL here and there, but that wasn't violence. To see some news channels calling us the real terrorists just pains me, it makes me sick to my stomach. I really wanna go back to the time before the coup.

>I thought the junta always maintained autonomy before the coup
It is totally different , i had lived 20 years under dictatorship before democracy. During that  law is only what comes from their mouth. Military dictators and their supporters take over any business and if rivals comes up , they wouln't even flinch but kill any business rivals and their family members ( The infamous , whole family Penta Homicide case which is closed  ) .  Their children would gang rape girls as young as 14 years old (9th grade student who was my friend from a wealthy) , and nobody even dare to touch  them. 

We live under  complete fear, close to North Korea like conditions  and then a few years after Saffron revolution , then we got democracy , in 2010 .

We didn't expect much , but  U Thein Sein - who was ex military , like it or not , did a lot of positive changes , Open Up Internet , Brings in Foreign ISPs , Tech jobs start to boom , Allow construction permits , released all political prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi and many positive changes (but he pro military so we didn't trust him at all) , but he did a lot of deals with china , including the Great Dam of Myit Sone , which could destroy whole ecosystem of Myanmar. So in 2015 we voted for NLD  , the National League of democracy and they win by landslide.
At First for NLD it was rough start , since they don't have much experience , but things got better each year , even under Covid economy is booming. And they won again in 2020 , landslide .

>  What has life been like since? 

Its all open , fun , carefree . We can go out night whole night till morning without anything to be worried. Very low crime rate , Myanmar people are fun loving and mostly positive. Salary was tripled thanks to economy booming (From 80$ / month , a fresh graduated programmer salary , to 300$/month within 1 year) . 
Foriegn investment and tech startups coming in and everyone life become easier. People can make money several way.

People can enjoy KFC , Yoogne , many  different brands coming in, Big Supermarkets are booming , Night life is fun , people are more opened up and educated .

But now , everything we had build over 10 years has been crashed down.

Now , they capture tortured and kill anyone they want , and labled as PDF . Could get shot if i am out driving before 6pm by Military thugs without any reason. Night life is totally gone.
Many businesses shuttled down and Economy was down 200%. 

All of the internet was banned and we have to use VPN just to browse Twitter.

> But is the work and life still going on like it used to or no?

No , BIG NO , Whole banking system have come to a halt. 
We cannot cash out money easily , we have to bribe  to cash out money from Bank. ATMs are all dead . Banks can only cash out 150$ per week per person, unless bribing bank officers or bribing who have money in hand (up to 10%) - if you want to cash out 10k$ you have to bribe 1000$ .

Everyone who goes to work have a chance to get shot first ask later even during bright day light. Many business had been shutdown , many foreign companies had been left . Electricity is now cutted 7 hr a day , for almost a week now. 

Zero security , Zero Health care - Since many top doctors are killed or got detained ( you can't go to hospital after 8pm , a friend of mine is in Crisis now , he have emergency situation and if she goes out after 8 pm , she could get shot on the way to hospital , if shes late for more than a few hr , she could die ).

Top medical professionals and other professionals had left so what left working are just nobodies with no skills or experience 

Difference is like Heaven vs Hell , if you like to know more , PM me i could tell you more, because i have to work just while power went back.",4,2,1637766765.0,Voxandr,negative,negative,positive,negative

Really ashamed to say this, but yes. Islamophobia is a huge thing here and there's a big reason kids with darker skin tones get bullied and called ""Kalar"" (which is a word mostly used to make fun of races and ethnicities with darker skin tones) And that's all coming from personal experience. As for the aligned part, there are Buddhist extremists set up by the military and those are different from the usual Buddhist monks. There's a guy called Wirathu and he's the biggest example of what I'm saying, sadly a lot of people seem to fall for their anti-muslim propaganda. Ethnic minorities straight up face terror attacks from the military as well. So they have it a lot worse than us.
