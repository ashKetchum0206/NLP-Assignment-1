While the US would prefer Myanmar not become a client state of China, it has no appetite nor significant enough interests to get involved. I doubt the people of Myanmar want US involvement either.

And there is no clearly defined goal for any foreign power to involved. Say a foreign power steps in, and say it defeats the military (which is battle hardened and might be tougher to handle than one thinks).

Then what? There are a dozen or so civll wars happening. The stuff in Rakhine gets all the news, but it is just a side show. And any foreign power who gets involved risks skirmishing with bordering states like China, India, Thailand. As well as ISIS, AQ in Bangladesh.

t1_glq2j8u,glqa1lk,"Oh come on now, don't pretend the US is not constantly expanding its power and influence all over the world. That's like the only thing the US did for the last 100 years. The difference being when China, Soviet, Turkey, and India did the same thing, you could actually blame them and point a big fat finger to whoever actually responsible, like how the world treat Xi Jinping today. US, on the other hand, did all those things yet every time a presidential election happened, people suddenly ""forget"" the bad shits US did all over the world. 

""Oh, Bush fucked Iraq so bad they literally went medieval. Sad shit but good thing we got Obama now so all is well."" 

""Oh, Obama fucked Syria so bad they caused a refugee crisis all over the world. Sad shit but good thing we got Trump now so all is well.""

""Oh, Trump fucked shits up even worse all over the world and it is literally a dumpster fire now. Sad shit but good thing we got Biden now so all is well."" 

See the problem? You can't point a finger even though US is as horrible or even more horrible than China (remember Vietnam? People are still suffering to this day there). The US can't and won't reform its approach to world politics because with every election people would think how better the US would be, while nothing actually changed. 

Take Biden, I bet the most thing he'd do for the world is merely to revise Iran nuclear deal. And that is still a big IF. Meanwhile the US would start another war somewhere in the world for its scummy businesses (also, isn't it more ""democracy backed by scummy businesses"" than the other way around?). 

I'm not saying that Xi's China is good shit, it's fucking horrible, but at least with China you could always point a finger and say ""Winnie the Pooh bad"".",2,9,1612274199.0,UsernameCzechIn,negative,negative,negative,negative
