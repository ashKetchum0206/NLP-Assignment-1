That's doesn't qualify as a standard of evidence. Once the acquisition is completed, you cannot hold the manufacturer accountable for its use.

Otherwise every gun manufacturer would be liable for their death.

t1_gvn4xm8,gw1fnun," I did read the article about drones, and again, the manufacturer and seller is not liable for its use.

I did some reading on the dam issue, assuming I found the right one:

https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/23/myanmar-china-dam-deal-junta-democracy/

It would seem that the military regime announced its resumption in hope of Chinese support — China has yet to openly endorse it because they seem to be aware of the negative optics.

So it doesn’t seem that China supported a coup for its dam. But rather the coup was indigenous and hoped to use the dam as leverage.",1,7,1619523854.0,longtermthrowawayy,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
