The US is on the verge of tearing itself apart, it's not going to be touching an all out war with a foreign power that most Americans cannot find on a map.

Also, it might be unpopular to say in here and frankly I'm an ignorant American so I'm not saying this to offer my personal opinion on what's obviously a very complicated situation, but when Aung San Suu Kyi got up in front of the UN and defended what is considered here to be a horrific genocide she and her government lost a great deal of credibility and sympathy in the West, particularly from the center-left (who are in power right now).  

The US is particularly uninterested in intervening to save a democratic government that has already proven incapable of preventing the military from committing what it considers genocide. 

 If western military support is one of the best hopes for the elected govt right now, then that govt made a *grave* error in its handling of the Rohinga crisis, because aside from the domestic turmoil in the US there are no liberal western democracies interested in putting their own soldiers on the line to protect genocide apologists.

Yeah we heard that same story in Iraq. What you are not telling readers (and you know this) is that Myanmar has ten times the number of ethnic groups as Iraq and BTW most of them are at war today with federal army.

If the US crushes the Burmese army, and leaves that will create a power vacuum. 

1. There will be genocide on the largest ethnic group, the Bamars, because there won't be anyone to defend them. The Bamars hate the Army, but they have a lot of sympathy for the soldiers who get killed by the insurgencies (especially those in Rakhine, where the so-called Rohingya insurgents have been stirring the pot -- aka ISIS and AQ puppets lead by Pakistanis and other foreigners)

2. Bangladesh will overwhelm the carcass. People will just walk into Rakhine and beyond and take. Take from the Buddhists and from the so called Rohingya.

3. A dozen countries will form from the aforementioned ethnic groups.

I had a very open minded group of people worked with me and we talked about culture, religion and history. But when it come to politic, I guess it can get very heated up hence they avoid the topic.

When you fly from say Yangon to say Heho, before you can leave airport, you have to present your passport.

Still though, the amount of territory under non-government control is not much in comparison to the rest of the country. Also, these groups are funded by the Chinese government either in terms of purchases through the blackmarket or developments by Chinese companies. The Golden Triangle is a huge mess similar to the Mexican cartels having control of regions in Mexico. You wouldn't categorize the cartels as armed ethnic groups so why would you do the same for these?

""Didn't really assimilated"" is a truly passive way to put it. In fact, the Bengalis in Rakhine State took advantage of the Japanese occupation to kill 20,000 non-Bengalis in Rakhine. The British then organized Bengalis to attack civilians in Rakhine as part of the British re-conquest of Myanmar. 

Later as part of the Pakistan Movement, Muslim Bengalis in Myanmar tried to separate Rakhine from Myanmar and merge it with fna East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). And the British had dirty hands here too.

After WWII, illegal waves of Bengalis flowed into Rakhine.

It is true that after the 1964 coup, the Army escalated the brutality, not just in violence, but in the form of the 1982 Citizenship Law, which failed to recognize Bengalis in Rakhine as one of 135 recognized ethnic groups of Myanmar entitled to citizenship.

So I've sympathy for both sides. Had the 1964 coup not happened, a lot of bad things in Myanmar today would not exist, and we'd be discussing Thailand as south east Asia's basket case.",1,4,1612291398.0,iranisculpable,negative,negative,negative,negative
