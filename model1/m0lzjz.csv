That's fundamentally easy to say if you're not in Burma. 

The military ravaged the country for decades, profiting off a resource rich country while the common people suffered. The average daily wage today of a Burmese worker is under $5, even lower than the US minimum hourly rate of $7.2. When the people eventually got fed up and fought back, they were brutally beaten down by the military. Again and again. One look at the military will tell you they are ruling through the threat of force instead of any actual legitimacy. There are about 450k soldiers, but only an actual handful get to enjoy their plunder. Now, in 2021, the same cycle is beginning and the people are desperately trying to turn the tide. We already have more than 50 killed and the military is very much capable of killing more.

There are whispers of the Right to Bear Arms going around here. Will it solve all the problems? Maybe not. Will it stop a coup? Only actual history will tell. Yet, the founders of America, one of the world's most robust democracies, left the country with the Right to Bear Arms for a reason. That very same reason is reinforced by what we're going through.",6,4,1615268902.0,twicedfanned,negative

This is why a fundamental right is required, not some government-allowed privilege.

A couple of relevant paragraphs:

""""""

Lawyer U Kyi Myint says that Myanmar firearms laws have generally given the authorities significant discretion in dispensing licences, stating only that they should go to people of “dignity” and “good character”.

Kyi Myint said this was not a problem during the post-independence democratic government, but subsequent military administrations gave priority for firearms ownership to high-profile military veterans and those with whom the juntas were closely associated.

t1_gqbw6yw,gqbwtnl,Yea so like an illusion of the right to bear arms. That is a good defense of the right and I feel I support it far more now,2,8,1615300385.0,TonyVstar,positive
t1_gqbwtnl,gqby54e,"Yeah, as a Buddhist, initially I didn't like the Right to Bear Arms, but as time goes on and government aggression becomes more obvious, I started to understand why it exists.

Think of it in terms of the JFK quote ""Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.""

As for gun crime, I suggest you look up about the US Prohibition era and the War on Drugs, initiatives that are said to have lead to mafia, cartels, and gangs despite their 'good' intentions.

t1_gqby54e,gqbyq3l,Yea guns plus gun control is what we need. Too many deaths from people firing their guns in the air. 70 deaths per year in north America from hunting accidents (only 1 per year from bears) those stats are why I've argued against gun ownership yet if the government corrupted and tried to remove freedom that could be the only salvation unless the UN decides to go full military,2,1,1615301261.0,TonyVstar,negative
t1_gqbyq3l,gqc1qx5,"Unfortunately, the problem I have with 'gun control' is that it's being pushed by people who don't seem to know much about firearms. I want actually nuanced bipartisan laws aimed at combatting 'gun violence', designed and made with cooperation with gun owners and gun rights groups.

I don't want shootings and gun crime. Yet, it's silly when people go off on vage ill-defined terms like  'assault rifle' and 'assault weapons'. It's absurd when Amnesty International declares a crisis in America due to gun crime, but not in worse countries like Honduras or Brazil.

It becomes insulting when they don't talk about mental health when shootings happen, instead the media goes hysterical about the AssaultRifle-15. I have a aunt whose institutionalised. I suspect I have ADHD/ADD. Yet, nobody seems to want to help people like us. I want mental illness laws when shootings happen, I want universal healthcare.

I'd want to reiterate I don't want gun violence or shootings. Yet, from what I can see, people are treating freedom and safety as polar opposites. I want to stop gun violence, and violence in general, but it must be done with all stakeholders in mind. Innocent gun owners included.",2,2,1615302519.0,twicedfanned,negative
t1_gqc1qx5,gqc2uhe,Exactly and well put! I think you should be able to purchase guns until you lose the right either by committing other criminal acts or by the missuse of a fire arm. In Canada they limit the assault aspect of rifles but 30 round clips still get in. We have fairly good Healthcare compared to the global standard yet mental health isn't even a tax write-off. If you can't afford it you are left going to group meetings like AA/NA,2,3,1615302976.0,TonyVstar,negative
t1_gqc2uhe,gqc558f,"What even are the 'assault aspects' of a rifle? You get hit by the bullet, not the gun's accessories. Heck, if you're referring to something like the Assault Weapons Ban, I say the M1 Garand and the K98 were both standard issue weapons for militaries and they would easily fly under the AWB.

Mental help is absolutely necessary. I think we very well agree on that. Shootings are wake-up calls for mental health, not for a type of rifle owned by millions.

On the other hand, I don't quite agree with 'criminal acts'. Not that I mean give all felons guns, but the circumstances around it. People, especially the blacks, get arrested for petty or victimless crimes, the 'correctional facilities' do nothing to correct them, they get slapped with a criminal history that prevent them from jobs. They commit crimes because they can do nothing else. Rinse and repeat. Instead of 'felons get no guns', the American justice system really needs some serious re-evaluation.",2,4,1615303891.0,twicedfanned,negative

30 round clips, copper coated/armor piercing bullets, and full auto

>On the other hand, I don't quite agree with 'criminal acts'.

I mean true criminal charges not felony offenses. Assault with a weapon, wreckless endangerment, attempted murder, etc

That would mean drinking and driving or selling drugs could lose you the right to firearms so maybe too much of a blanket clause but I find it mind blowing when someone with a long list of criminal offenses shoots up somewhere with the guns they were able to purchase",2,5,1615304312.0,TonyVstar,negative
t1_gqc68b4,gqc81kq,"I disagree on the 'assault aspects', even full-auto. Difficult to control, difficult to aim, quickly eats through limited ammo, lack of actual criminal history, and so forth. I think the 2ALiberals sub will give you more answers if you want.

For criminal acts, I think it'll be difficult to define what would be the limit. For instance, selling drugs because you have no job and is short on money seems like you need help getting a job. Yet, you could also be genuinely 'evil'. Repeated crimes may be the answer, but I don't know.",2,6,1615305016.0,twicedfanned,negative
t1_gqc81kq,gqc8vsv,Definitely hard to draw the line but looking at Myanmar I can't help but feel like they just need to open fire on the military from their apartment windows.

t1_gqc8vsv,gqca81k,"You should look up the circumstances the military lives in. The generals live comfortably, but their lackeys eat out of plastic bags from the floor.

You'd also have to take into account the soldiers themselves. The military has about 450,000 men but from what I hear the recruitment standards are very low. Many are said to be illiterate, similarly many are said to have joined purely for money because they're so poor. That's how a son of an acquaintance joined the military; one soldier and the family get about $250. The elites are the infamous Light Infantry Divisions (33, 55, 77, etc.), but they're limited and stretched thin.

Given that some armed rebel groups have already started to put pressure on the military, I believe we have a chance if, and when the fighting starts.",1,8,1615305873.0,twicedfanned,negative
