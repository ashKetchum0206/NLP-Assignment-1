t3_lvvvm8,gskllgk,"As an Burmese this is really sad

The military show no mercy, even for kids. They shot 3 year olds and 13 year olds. They threw grenades at people and killed hundreds. You could see the dead bodies on Facebook, but I suggest not to. They also killed a doctor for supporting NLD. There’s a rumor that our leader of NLD is on a hunger strike. Our country needs help but the UN isn’t doing shit. 

They are scaring people to not protest but we fought back, not physically. I’ve experienced this before a few weeks ago. The soldiers came to our peaceful neighborhood to create chaos because were too quite. They shot guns on the street. A street dog attack the soldiers and got shot by the soldiers. Thankfully they didn’t come blasting the door down and killing us. Although this happened to many neighborhoods. We were lucky 

This isn’t a cool thing. People are dying for our country and the fighting back. A dad was carrying his dead son and crying and shouting 

My son is dead

He was in tears and the video was recorded.

>guns dont kill people jackass, people do

*People with guns*. I'm not sure why gun nuts think this is an effective argument. Nobody has ever suggested that guns kill people without being fired by humans. It really doesn't change the argument at all. Access to guns, and their relative speed and ease of use when it comes to killing people, results in thousands more murders. It also drives the suicide rate, and is why we have so many cases of parents killing their own kids. People are way, way more likely to kill with a gun than they are with a knife or any other weapon, and for good reason. Guns offer a quick, clean and easy way to kill. Most people are too squeamish to start hacking at human flesh with a knife. You have to be right on your victim, right up close to the blood and the guts, with your victim fighting back. Guns give people the option of killing from a distance, without having to deal with the gore and the tearing of flesh and the fighting back. Having a gun in the drawer gives people going through moments of flashpoint rage a quick and convenient method to act on that rage in a deadly fashion, where that rage would have passed without murder had there been no gun available. Also established fact: gun owners are more likely to die by gunfire than non gun owners, and their kids are more likely to be murdered. Guns are *very much* the issue here, and I very much *do* know what I'm talking about. 

>...you just hate America for no reason dont you

No, it's certainly not true that ""nearly all"" of the violence takes place in a few select cities. In fact, *half* the violence happens in 127 cities, including the larger ones. The fact that they have stringent gun laws is irrelevant - the fact is that *all* of these illegal guns started life as legal guns, and were only manufactured because there is a huge market for them in a country awash in gun culture. All of the guns found in cities like NYC and Chicago were either bought in states with lax gun laws or they were stolen from irresponsible legal gun owners who didn't secure them adequately. They were then transported across state lines and sold in predominantly low income inner city areas, where they drive the murder rate. Besides which, Dallas has widespread legal gun ownership and its per capita murder rate is consistently four times that of NYC according to FBI figures. 

>And finally, there is quite a bit of data that indicates reducing gun laws and allowing concealed carry laws to be put in effect actually decreases murder and crime rates.

What do you mean birghter future of persecuted groups? Its literally 1 group and she denied their genocide. As such there would be no ""brighter future"" until they either flea or are dead. One small UN intervention would have stopped your military coup d'état from happening.

If youre talking about ASRA then yeah they are at war with them. I dont condone what they do/did but they only popped up when they started getting killed. Killing innocents is deplorable for any group. But the other Arkanese are again buddhists backd by the national army because the army is also one of the killers of the Rohinya as well.",1,3,1614923434.0,foxdye96,negative
t1_gpje14k,gpjgpjq,"No, the actions of the MILITARY that none of us elected and are now actively fighting against are divorced from the will of the people. They’re the ones that enacted genocide. You have no idea what the political situation here is and has been for the last 60 years. In India, the people elected authoritarian nationalists; in Myanmar, the people elected the alternative. In India, the government is in charge of the military; in Myanmar, the military is in charge of itself. No, there wasn’t dead silence regarding the Rohingya in this country. 

Have some empathy man. When I hear about what goes on in India I don’t think: “oh well, they deserve it, they voted for Modi after all!” I knew someone that was killed today. 19 years old, full of life and courage. She wasn’t genocidal. I can guarantee the other 17 (and counting) protesters that were killed today were not genocidal.",2,4,1614784177.0,BlueElephants4,negative

Unfortunately it’s not just the Rohingya that are facing persecution. The Kachin, the Karen, the Shan, hell I could go on. These people deserve a future as well, and if at the end of this we can repatriate the Rohingya refugees (which I don’t think is unlikely), then great.

t1_gpjt4cu,gpjul7w,"Tell me which one is correct.
1. Suu Kii is a hypocrite and a tyrant who went along with the military's genocidal plan.
2. Suu Kii was against the plan but her government never held true power in the country, thus Myanmar was never a democracy in the first place, just a sham
3. Suu Kii was just a puppet for the military all along.

Now, if it's not (1), then the question arises, what did Suu Kii do to anger the military enough for them to take over; what agenda did she have that was more important for her than the lives of thousands of Rohingyas?

Your stupid ass hypothesis doesn't hold water. Even from your perspective, it's clear that the Burmese gave 0 shits when minorities were being killed, and suddenly all the sacrifices made for political games became too much when they themselves were the ones on the losing end.",1,9,1614790237.0,Adm_Kunkka,negative
t1_gpjul7w,gpjx1s1,"2 is correct.

What did she do? She won in a landslide in the last election. The military lost more seats in Parliament than they anticipated.

Her agenda? I can only guess, but most likely a slow phasing out of military rule, building a democratic future for all of us INCLUDING the Rohingya.

This population has been lied to all this time. Even then we held sympathies for persecuted minorities. We have lost thousands before against the military, so this idea that we didn’t care is completely false.",1,1,1614791280.0,BlueElephants4,neutral
