Tribalism, sectarianism, ultra nationalism and religion were the main reason why the majority supported the army genocide against the Rohingyas.

The Rakhine crisis is much deeper and more complex than the few articles u read on Aljazeera and BBC. It is one part of the entire dark histroy of Myanmar under the nearly 7 decade long military dictatorship. This revolution also involves other ethnic groups who has been continuously persecuted under the regime for  decades. If you have no knowledge of the other ethnic groups, or the political and history context of the country, then your opinion doesn't weigh anything. 

You have a holier than thou attitude? Go and actually help the Rohingyas who needs funding for development in their camps. I'm more than happy to give you the links (not through UN or NGOs.

It is a relatively safe (though not completely safe) way to protest as not everyone can join armed groups or participate in flash protests. And given how many people are abiding by the strike, this was easily accomplished. As for why a strike for one month isn't held, the average worker cannot sustain that for a whole month as a significant percentage of the population of Myanmar live off what they make day by day. Besides, there are already mass boycotts of military linked and crony businesses and the economy is already in the toilet anyways.

Soldiers and police have threatened shop owners to open up today. There have been cases of security forces breaking into closed shops and looting them likely as an intimidation tactic. I don't think the junta's military would be doing that if the strike was truly ""useless"". It just goes to show you that no matter how many people they kill, throw in jail, and censor, they cannot actually establish firm control over the country almost a year on from the coup.

Also, it is nice that you went from trying to pretend that barely any people are observing to strike to now claiming that the strike is useless. Keep moving those goal posts.",6,3,1639118734.0,VikingJoseph,neutral
