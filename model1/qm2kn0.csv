t1_hjasojy,hjbdvst,"No, US gets shit on because of shit like CIA overthrowing democratic governments in South American countries like Chile, Bolivia, etc, funding mujahedeen just to weaken the USSR, backing up Pol Pot just to weaken Vietnam, being part of Suharto's mass murder in Indonesia, etc. And the Vietnam war - France refused to let go of their colonies and US was like ""sure why not"" as if americans are okay with colonialism, and americans ended up getting fucked in the ass in Vietnam by farmers who wanted nothing but their country to be independent.

Nobody complained when US went to war because the twin towers got blown up. Nobody complained when Bin Laden was taken out by special forces.

People shit on US when they get involved because 8/10 times they got involved, they did it not for good reasons. People shit on US when they don't get involved because people know US won't get involved for good reasons.

Shit, there were worse tragedies in other parts of the world US could have easily had under control (like Rwanda genocide for example), yet they didn't do anything (although for fairness's sake, fucking Belgians are more to be blamed for the rwandan genocide than the US).

Because of what CIA has done in the past, I'm not in favor of US involvement, especially not in a clusterfuck country like Myanmar, because US involvement usually means they have some shit planned behind our backs which might not exactly be good.

Most likely, they will do to us what the British did to us back during the colonial era. One of the things they’ll do is that they will deindustrialize us, putting many people out of work and destroying local businesses, then they will bring their own brands and construct factories, and then they will hire our now unemployed and desperate people, who are all willing to work for pitiful, meager wages so that those companies can make a bigger profit and take the lion’s share of the country’s wealth.",2,2,1636227247.0,SabatonStuff,negative
