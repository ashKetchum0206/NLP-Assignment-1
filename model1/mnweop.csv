t3_mnweop,gu0loj5,This is civil war. I said it last month. Too many good people die in vain. Heroes. Good soldiers. Juntas don't care about protests or human beings and they will unapologeticly claim that civilians are the ones who are destroying the country. More bloodbaths are coming. I'm not religous but everyone knows that there comes a time to talk to God. May the gods be with the people of Myanmar and guide them in this difficult time.,34,0,1618033162.0,non-spesifics,negative

t3_mnweop,gu1a8gp,"I know exactly how it felt like Bago. The whole town will feel like evil spirit is coming from somewhere and that everyone is scared even to turn your light on. You know it is real because it can’t be everyone unreasonably scare for no reason. There must be something inhumane was done to someone and someone must have seen it to be speechless. If this is to be manipulated and fake, I wonder how could someone make it at such a large scale and to touch the deepest level of one’s fear. The next morning the whole city pretend it to be normal but everyone is watching their back no shop or anything open even street dogs are not on the street. Sad faces, stones to mark on the spot of fallen hero’s and bloody spots on the road. The streets are all clear for about a week until monks can mourn the loss of life’s. People are speechless and helpless waking up with mistrust and realization that could really happen in Myanmar.

Now you know how it feels. Why should any westerner support people that have no respect or value the benefits of tolerance and ethnic diversity and embrace the values of such a society? Don't give me a reason cause you haven't got one except the innocent children that have not yet been corrupted by the communities that they depended on to teach them right from wrong and good from evil instead of infecting them with racial, ethnic and religious hatred, as you attempt to justify a genocide. That's not very Buddhist is it now. If you had stood up for the Royhinga perhaps the Tatmadaw wouldn't have become so empowered by your acceptance of such atrocities and crimes against humanity. Unfortunately it is now your innocent children that are going to be mentally scared by your ambivalence, disrespect and lack of empathy and abandonment of morals and ethics as you now become the victims of your fate.",-34,0,1618034894.0,Significant-Day945,negative
