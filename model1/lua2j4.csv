t3_lua2j4,gp61y7s,"Look guys realistically speaking, there isn't much the UN can do as far as I know. The most they can do so far is sanctions and weapons embargo, beyond that I am not sure what they can do. Civil war definitely must not happen. The people in Myanmar are aware of this and so far they have been treating some of the policemen as humanely as possible and trying to deter mobs from attacking the policemen.",8,0,1614517273.0,MoonLightWarrior,negative

t3_lua2j4,gpa5jzc,"Fighting back against the police and military will be useless and foolish. UN can only do so much which is very little. The best the protestors can fight back is to hold posters encouraging the military commanders to switch to the protestors' side--only these people can bring down the coup leadership... and when the commanders start to revolt, the end of the military will be over quickly. Hold as many such posters as possible and hand flowers to soldiers and policemen in the streets to show that protestors are their friends and country men.

t1_gp5kz2h,gp5o7j0,"Eh... If UN forces intervenes and oust the govt, then whats next? I tell you, intervention sounds easy, but with the Myanmar military might, it might led to a long drawn war (which the military may lose ofc) at the cost of many civilian lives. You can look at Libya, as you raised, or Iraq. Libya hasnt stabilised into a democracy yet and is still in civil war",11,2,1614507649.0,Zkang123,negative
t1_gp5kz2h,gp5ucns,"Take note that UN don't send army into a country to intervene just because they have civil wars. 

The US however does. But every country that the US intervenes in normally ends up as a war zone like Iraq and Syria - and become a failed state afterwards. The US only intervenes if it is in their national interest to do so i.e. the country has oil that it wants or the country has terror groups that attacked the US like Afghanistan (Al Qaeda). See video

2.  “How the US failed to rebuild Afghanistan” [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKVDXbIpW9Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKVDXbIpW9Q)

Take note that US itself can also be considered to be a failed state as on 6th Jan 2021 when Congress was certifying Biden as the next president a bunch of extremists instigated by President Trump stormed Capitol Hills to try to stop the proclamation that Biden is the next president. In this attack 5 people died and 140 people were injured. On 20th Jan 2021 25,000 National Guards had to be deployed at Capitol Hill in order to ensure a ""peaceful"" transfer of power from Trump to President Biden. So, the US has its own internal problems to resolve and will not be able to look at Myanmar's internal problem.",6,2,1614511509.0,Ok_Consideration6043,negative

t1_gp5o7j0,gp6c4lb,"We currently feels like dying in war is better then staying alive while being suppressed.
It's obvious that war isn't the solution to this. But we are desperate. It's been only a month and the situation is this bad.
If this goes on people would eventually lose the spirit.
The blames on UN are just like a baby crying and being mad at their parents because they don't get what they want, tho this is quite a different situation.
Over 26 people have died today across the country.
We don't know how many will die tomorrow.
We can't sleep well at night. They drop thugs armed with gasoline and ropes, to bring houses and create chaos.

In conclusion, all the stress we've accumulated in those 28 days, are exploding. And we are not satisfied by UN's actions.
Thus UN become a target to blame. But I do believe, UN would be able to bring the military junta to the court.
That's the only hope.

t1_gp6c4lb,gp8oh8b,"No military can function without lots of 18 year-olds who think they are bulletproof. Well, they really aren't. Right now, Myanmar has too many of those, so the revolutionary fervour is still strong. Once the blood start flowing then it will recede. Death is irreversible; poverty can be overcome. 

Myanmar generals are some of the most isolated people on Earth. They don't really speak many foreign languages, don't travel or work overseas, and their friends and enemies, dreams and nightmares, are all in Myanmar. Poor Burmese travel and work overseas; the generals don't. So even if they are convicted with crimes, no punishment can be imposed on them; unless, say the US Navy Seal somehow can kidnap them off their base and extradite them; but that's incredibly unlikely.",1,4,1614553965.0,None,negative
t1_gp6qrba,gp86b2c,"It's called a proxy war in that case. Most civil wars are proxy wars where great powers give weapons and support to one, both, or more sides.
