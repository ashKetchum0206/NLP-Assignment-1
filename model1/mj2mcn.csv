t1_gt8bz12,gt8pzyy,"When you see these posts, you need to understand that we are not against the Chinese people.  But, we are against CCP policies on Myanmar.

Myanmar should be a lesson for Chinese citizens. Prosperity without freedom, you risk to lose everything. Under the democratic government, although with very little power they had, Myanmar was moving towards prosperity. Once the guy at the top went and made a crazy move, the country turns into a failed state. It's not because of the Junta leader that Myanmar fails, it's the system. The bad system of allowing a dictator to have too much power. Allowing a dictator to control and command everything. So long as you have good dictators who make right decisions, things will be OK. But, once a bad one is in charge, people lose everything. That's because the system is set up that way.

It's even more worrying for China. If president Xi decides to wage war with the west and invades Taiwan, a lot of people could die. It's just his ambition and the legacy that he wants to leave as a guy who unites China but it will be at the expense of the prosperity and safety of Chinese people. Correct me if I am wrong, currently Chinese citizens, even for a little, cannot criticize the CCP or PLA or even the police -- essentially people have no power against their government. Look at Jack Ma, relatively powerful man with huge wealth, CCP can take it away from him overnight.

And, Myanmar citizens know that what CCP says in front of the world and the media is not what they do. There is no transparency.

t1_gt8wh3h,gt9b2es,"I definitely understand what you're saying. The very unfortunate fact of the matter is that the conduct that is occurring, does not appear to fit within the scope of any legal justification that would obligate China to agree with the remainder of the UN. I just read through ""Universal Jurisdiction,"" which is only relevant and applicable to hold individuals accountable to stand trial as accused (not military intervention), and from what I can tell, in order for Universal Jurisdiction to apply, it would need to be filed by a State — a country willing to do so, which the US has never done — and must also be investigated within the State in which the alleged offenses took place. That means the junta would have to be willing to open an investigation into its own conduct, which it has the local jurisdictional the right to refuse. 

Police action, or enforcement action, most commonly known by modern standards as counter-insurgency, is only applicable when an ""insurgency"" can be established. 

""When insurgency is used to describe a movement's unlawfulness by virtue of not being authorized by or in accordance with the law of the land, its use is neutral. However, when it is used by a state or another authority under threat, ‘insurgency‘ often also carries an implication that the rebels' cause is illegitimate, whereas those rising up will see the authority of the state as being illegitimate."" (F. Weigand, 2017, afghan's taliban — legitimate jihadists or coercive extremists? From the Journal of Intervention and Statebuilding) which makes it sound like it not apply due to the junta's claim of election fraud and its declaration to hold new elections in one year.

In the case of China blocking action by the UN, they're doing so based on: 1) the claim that it is an ""internal matter"" and a ""cabinet reshuffle"" and 2) speculative, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, ""And the largest foreign player in Myanmar's economy, China, will be all too happy to recalibrate its engagement to recognize the new facts on the ground""

It's probably safe to assume that the Chinese government is resistant to an even greater presence of the US in Asia. Historically, any time the US military sets foot in a country, they begin to establish a military bases in that country. There are currently over 800 military bases in foreign countries all across the world, with hundreds of thousands of troops deployed throughout.

The way I interpret all of this tells me that, until China comes on board with the rest of the UN, there are no legal grounds for military intervention without a declaration of war or a straight up invasion, which would likely set the stage for, at minimum, a conflict between whichever invading country is present, Myanmar's junta, and China, since it would be their UN opposition that was ignored. In that event, it would likely set the stage for WW3. At this point it appears as though the only thing can be done is unilateral sanctions by individual countries, but from what I've read, more invested countries in the area, such as vietnam and Japan, are unlikely to impose unilateral sanctions because of their vested interests within Myanmar. Whereas the US does not have much of a vested interest or presence at all, sanctions imposed by the US will have little impact. Furthermore, unilateral sanctions are more likely to negatively impact the civilian population rather than the junta. 

So, in essence, you are entirely correct that humanitarian rights/law is actively being violated, the perpetrators of such can be subjected to universal jurisdiction under the Geneva Conventions, namely under Article 3. But, as you said in your first statement that you feel as though China is blocking protection of the civilian population, your feeling would appear to be entirely accurate.

From all I've read up to this point, until an armed group large enough to pose a threat to the junta and can be considered an ""insurgency"", it doesn't look like China has any real obligation to backpedal on its current standpoint to allow a counter-insurgency. Even if an insurgency were to be established, which side China would take is anybody's guess.",2,4,1617467344.0,keepitquickk,neutral

t1_gt8m5q6,gt8yg78,"Burma is geo politically very important for China. This is a known facts that everyone who are familiar with international politics and global affair. There are many ways China involved in Myanmar politics obvious one is supporting armed ethnic groups for insurgencies. Democratic and peaceful multi interests independent Myanmar will make a difficult field for China to compete with the west, Japanese and the OIC countries. In that scenario, China will not get special favor like while dealing with the illegitimate regime. I have a lot of optimism on China based on what our leader mentioned before she was detained. She said China is truly a good friend and a good neighbor to Myanmar. I was expecting China to send clear message to the inhumane behaviors of the junta will not be tolerated in today’s world. But when China issue statement to protect its business (merely 5 garment factories) while ignoring the loss of hundred of lives, I have to lower my expectations on China to be a moral leader to save our declining humanity. It is time for China to reconsider its foreign policy to be more human oriented than its own interest protected. If China wants to be in leading role in the world, now is the best time to show its good will. I believe for the very reason central Asian and African nations are not very happy with self-centered Chinese investments around the world. 
So China please use your gigantic power to spread peace, prosperity, justice and promote our shared humanity above your self economics and poltical interest in this kind of difficult time. I am sure you will get the respect and loving kindness from the rest of the world in return.",7,8,1617460554.0,Just_ic_proud,neutral
