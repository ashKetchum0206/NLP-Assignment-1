t3_mkie5r,gtk2vqp,I envy you people fighting against China. While my country is full of traitors.,5,0,1617708135.0,effleurer226,negative
t3_mkie5r,gtgsadk,"I think we woke up the wolf warriors of CCP and PLA.

Plain and simple: if a country block the UNSC sanctions or condemnation against baby killing Myanmar military junta, we are against that country. Because killing innocent civilians and children are not condone by anyone who can call themselves human.

If that’s OK for China, keep blocking the UN sanctions against Myanmar junta. Yes, our feelings are hurt when we see our youth and children are murdered. But, we know that CCP and PLA doesn’t give a crap as long as money is to be made. 

We don’t hate Chinese citizens, we just wish that you take our country as an example and hope your dear leader doesn’t take it out on the citizens when you express an opinion that is against him.

At least we are brave enough to pick our freedom more than materials and wealth under oppression.",13,0,1617638431.0,circletrain,negative

t3_mkie5r,gtl84kr,"The one thing that Chinese government fears the most is its own citizens.  The world is watching and learning from Myanmar people how to fuckup a dictator.   CCP is unusually quiet about Myanmar with its domestic news so the Chinese people don’t learn some new revolutionary ideas. 

The generals’ balls are getting squeezed because they need $1B USD per month to keep their 300K monkeys from using their guns on them. 

The dumb monkeys are not going to die for the generals if they don’t get pay. With no banks and no paper and ink to print their toilet paper, their days are very numbered.",5,0,1617728620.0,shadow95116,negative
