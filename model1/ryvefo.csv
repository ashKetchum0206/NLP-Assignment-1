All analysis shows she was afraid of being deligitimised by bamar vote bank rather than the military. She's faced the military before and tolerated it.

Her appearance at the international court to defend the military was the last straw for what was left of her credibility. 

So there is no surprise that there is total indifference in the western world when it comes to ASSK now.  

She made a cold and calculated decision by defending a genocide that was taking place right under her nose just to appease the military and the majority of the people that voted for her (bamars) 

The same military has her ass locked now.
