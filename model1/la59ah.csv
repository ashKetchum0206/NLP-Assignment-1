t3_la59ah,gm46lbu,".Let me give you a quick recap of our country's history. The military had control over the country for nearly 30 years in the past, (started off by killing most important generals, straight up gunning down protestors including a couple thousands of students and monks, creating corruption beyond measure, and selling away all the country resources for their own good, letting ppl starve under a dictatorship ).  But since the democratic party won the election in 2015 with a landslide victory, they lost their previous authority/ways get corrupted money. The last 5 years has been quite stable in the country except for the Rohingya crisis that was also carried out by the same murderers from the military. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi went out there at the ICJ for the face and name of the fellow Burmese citizens,(didn't have the power to do anything other than that). Fast forward to the coup happening... 2020 elections saw the most votes for the democratic party in history. Just as the citizens were hoping of erasing their bs laws they had set out during their rule, the military seized all the members who are in charge right in the middle of a parliament meeting. (reasoning that there was fraud in the votes and they had to do the right thing!!) They also staged instability/protests in the country to find a proper reason for an emergency takeover. (also cutting off all networks and phone lines). Most of the democratic leaders and political speakers are now detained and sent to jail for really absurd reasons like( owning a walkie-talkie: how Daw Su was framed, breaking covid safety rules: how our president was framed, and sometimes for no reason). Now they are threatening us with the weapons that we; civilians bought through taxes. The military has a good relationship with China and is ready to illegally sell all of the country's resources once again to get all the money they can for themselves. Now, this may sound highly biased but all of them are certainly true- you can ask Burmese ppl, I doubt that it would be any different.

It cannot be overemphasized how much that act will complicate any efforts to attract western interest in intervention.

I appreciate that she might have been pressured into doing that by the military, but it was a grave miscalculation on her part if that is the case.
