Our only hope is for other countries' government to help release our citizens rights and free the government party which was elected by the general public. The military didn't want the democratic party, NLD, to reduce their power and authority, so they have been inciting many polical propaganda and political unrest. And now they took over the government as an excuse for unrest and protests within the country which was actually started by them. The Rohingya genocide crisis was mainly handled by the military which the democratic party have no control over. Although, when Gambia took this case to the Supreme Court of Justice. The one to clean up their mess was the main leader of the democratic party, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Still we can't blame the military for all of it, it was the citizens fault also. I deeply apologize.

t1_gljbw7y,gljdjtk,"Well here it is in brief:

\- General elections was held in Nov

\- Pro-democracy NLD won 83% of votes, military backed party thrashed compared to the previous election, even in their own strongholds

\- Military took the Trump playbook and started claiming election fraud

\- NLD tried to negotiate and the election commission concluded that there was no fraud large enough to invalidate the results

\- Military took the matter to supreme court wanting judgement against the election commission. Supreme court told them to wait until they decide if they would even take up the case

\- Meanwhile, Military Commander-in-chief Senior Gen Min Aung threatened to abolish the constitution

\- Western countries asked the military to honour the elections

\- Today, the parliament was supposed to convene after the elections.

\- Military pre-emptively is trying to block that

**In terms of the personal motivation of the Commander-in-chief Senior Gen Min Aung:**

\- Commander-in-chief Senior Gen Min Aung is due to retire in July 2021. He was fearful of what could happen post his retirement given the accusations of Genocide.

\- Pinned hopes in the election to win seats to sway enough electoral votes come March 2021 to become president. But the military suffered electoral setback in the parliamentary elections.

*Hence the plan B: Coup*

**Motivations of the military in General (especially the hardliners):**

The military has become fearful that the overwhelming win of the NLD could paved the way for constitutional change which would cut down the present 25% of the seats reserved for the military in the parliament. In the long run that would reduce military's influence and impact on military's business interests. So take over, suspend the constitution and party like 1962!",3,1,1612138094.0,godofones,neutral

t1_glkfc6h,glkjef3,Yes this morning I passed ASSK's home and the American Embassy on my way to work. There was a truck of armed military parked right in front (about 12 soliders). But other than that no. There were a few tanks around the city a few days ago but i didn't saw them.,1,5,1612160137.0,smolmummy,neutral

China is **buying** those resources. Not taking the them for free like the brits and shipping them to UK. 

It's nobody's fault that you have a dysfunctional state where laws don't exist or are not enforced, corruption is rampant, and with few exeptions, the people in power don't care about the wellbeing of the people. Don't expect China or any other country to come and govern your country.",2,5,1612167368.0,ouiiuo-oui,negative

t1_gljwr2t,gljy11j,"There's literally no similarities at all. For there to be a correlation you'd have to have the official US Military be the ones to storm the capital, capture and arrest Biden, and cut off all telecommunications before they inevitably announce there's been a change of government. Were the Trump protestors US Military attempting to take over control of the US Government?",3,5,1612147867.0,ChanRakCacti,negative
t1_gljwr2t,glk4niu,"The USA coup attempt doesn’t have a lot of good comparisons. Perhaps the March on Rome. 

Straight military coups happen relatively often, especially in Southeast Asia, and even with precedent in Myanmar. That certainly doesn’t mean this is a good thing, but there are many other regional military coups that make better sense as a comparison.",2,5,1612151165.0,rmarti78,negative

Sorry but I refuse to apologize for the perceived actions of the public who have been oppressed for literal centuries into obedience and brainwashed by the state. They have literally no control over their rights as criticizing the military results in loss of freedom or life.   


He has no right to condemn a society he does not understand and paint them as some sort of genocide happy monsters. Was he here advocating for all the oppressed people of Myanmar, or did he just pick a pet cause to browbeat everyone with without any understanding of nuance?  


Again, he is celebrating this coup in all his comments despite the fact that the situation for everyone, including the Rohingya will be far worse.",2,6,1612165708.0,drbkt,negative
t1_glkfsre,glkkr9w,Yes many people only think Myanmar is about rohingya they have no idea. It is the Muslim dominated love affair media in western nations causing this. They do not know 888 uprising or plight other Myanmar peoples. Our shit military make us poor and that's why everyone hate Myanmar military.
