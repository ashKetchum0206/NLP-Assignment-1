I also want to note that proving to yourself and the world that you are not afraid of anything is a bad attitude, which can lead to trouble for you and your friends. It is okay to have fear. In fact, it is a rare anomaly when someone has no fear. When you control your fear, fear protects and helps you, fear as a friend advises when the risk is too great, but when fear controls you, it paralyzes you and the result may even kill you.",23,0,1619622749.0,IntuitiveAir,neutral

t3_n0f7dj,gw7e3is,"Useless symbolic gesturing. Pool your resources together, acquire arms through black market, raise a militia, and actually do something of more value.

Stop blaming others like UN, ASEAN, US, etc. for not helping. It's your country. Take responsibility. There are countries from equal or worse circumstances who've done better.

If millions of Bamar cannot create an armed resistance in this day and age while ethnic minorities have tried for the past 70 years and succeeded to some extent, you guys are useless

It's 2021. No more excuses. Do something or remain the way you were for the past 7 decades. That's the harsh reality

One would blame those organisations when these organisations/countries claimed to promote democracy, yet non of those have the ball to go against dictatorship China and Russia, and being push back easily against the values they hold. Pity! It was wrong for Myanmar people to think they will come to rescue for being peaceful. We already know they are useless.

t1_gwbidrx,gwczct6,"I can't understand why you are mocking her action.

What is it that you are blaming at? Do you think they are coward cause they protest peacefully so they can get nothing with their protest? Then what do you think about the sacrifice of over 750 and over 4,000 of 8888? Is it less than your sacrifice of ethnic armored? They are risking their lives coz they can be shot any time, any where on the street. You have your armor to protect you at least. They just throw their bare bodies on the bullets. But I don't want blame you coz it's your belief and mind.   
Do you think they can get nothing from their peaceful protest? I don't think so.  
At least they get achieved more than you. Do you think you can get change or progress in this protest without support of normal citizen? I believe you may get no progress in this battle without their support and change of mind. In every revolution, citizens will make the historical progress, not the small armored activity.  
Than what do you want? Do you want citizens' acceptance of junta? No? Maybe No. Than do you insist every protesters should join ethnic army? Do you have enough armors to arm and foods to feed them? 

Do you believe your mocking will make more citizens to join armored ethnic army?  
If you are leaders of ethnic army and your understanding of current protest is like this, I will not join you for common fight.

Second. Are you insisting you will not unite with Barmar coz they oppress and disunite you historically? Don't you want unification by historical cause? I heard some Barmar's saying sorry about history and want to unite with you. So what do you want? Disunification? I don't believe you want disunification cause you can get nothing(no progress) with this? Then What? Do you insist real unification is joining ethnic army? I don't think so. I believe unification  is their will, mind and spirit for unification of them. I think you can insist they can win by young protester's joining ethnic army but you don't deserve to blame and mock peaceful protesters. 

I believe there's many battle fields in current protest like armored struggle, street protest, ethnic unification, progress of citizen's consciousness, global interests, internal consciousness change in junta terrorists.  I believe we can win by winning in this all battle fields. And I believe you need to do your best in your position and cheer up all other participants of other battle fields who are fighting against terrorist junta together with you.

The kind of bravery someone mustered does not need to be same nor of equal value to another. One could be dependent on another. Imagine all the civilian don’t show any sort of resistance, either big or small, just a small population takes arms and fight (because obviously not everybody can fight), do you think they will win? I don’t think so. 

Take Kachin, as we know they have been in fighting with arms alone. How long has it been? For like 70 years? Why? Because taking arms alone can’t fight back mate. You need people support. 

What about civilian who just keep defying the authority without support from arm resistance? Will they last long? Hell no! So don’t be close minded and I hope you see the bigger picture.
