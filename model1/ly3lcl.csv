t1_gpqwruw,gptb16r,"I don’t know if you’re American, but I’ll try to answer from an Americans perspective.


The military want *their* faction in power. That’s all. It almost happened here in the states. To those with power, equality very frequently appears to them as oppression and they’ll tear down any system that threatens to lift others out of the gutter even if it doesn’t threaten the quality of life of those in power. The Myanmar opposition was not in power and the military supported the opposition. So they lied about election fraud and demanded recounts, do-overs, and finally they demanded the keys to government at the tip of the spear.


Exactly what happened in the US except our minority party is full of losers from the fries and a milkshake militia drunk off that Qock (the Q conspiracy bullshit). Our minority party found out super quick that military and law enforcement as whole institutions were, in fact, not supportive of their bullshit whatsoever. This is not so in Myanmar. Also, our minority party (I love saying that) recently lost control of both the executive and the legislative branches of government due to the last 4 years laying bare their abject hatred of their fellow Americans, which is also a direct comparison to what’s happening in Myanmar and also addresses your question about how could they do this to their fellow countrymen. 


It’s easy to answer your question if you’re an American. Just look at the modern Republican Party. If you’re not an American, pick up any book about the Third Reich.",4,1,1614976477.0,ttyp00,neutral

t1_gpqyiq5,gpr1bnu,"Basically our long time military oppressors (the same one who massacred the Rohingyas) led a coup staging ""election fraud"" against our democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the NLD. There is no proof of election fraud and the lies keep switching up. The leaders and the party we voted for has been arrested (on some BS charge like owning walky talkies) and disbanded (kinda). The military stated that there was a state of emergency, which allows them to take over a year, which is stated in the constitution that they wrote. They say they will hold ""free and fair"" elections during the year, but history has shown us that these dogs aren't to be trusted.

So now, we're on the streets to free our leaders and rewrite the constitution, which will lead to a more fair democracy with a more fair ground for ethnic minorities (Rohingyas, Karens and so on). Every night from 8 PM to 4 AM, we have a curfew and they'll shoot us if we're more than 5 during these times. The internet is shut off from 1AM to 9PM. During the nights, they've been arresting activists, students, lawyers, doctors and more. 

Our nights aren't safe and our days aren't safe. So we do what we can for a better future. And the result has been our ppl getting butchered, as seen in the posts. The post doesn't show all deaths so far, just a fraction.
