t3_mf3yqa,gslx8wf,If you want my honest opinion one of the most effective soft(?) tactics I've seen over the years is getting footage of their personal estates and disseminating it strategically. Drone footage essentially. Think what Navalney did with Putin's Palace.,46,0,1616958852.0,None,neutral
t3_mf3yqa,gsm9h0a,"The UN can only do what states allow it to do. It is the States that have power, not the UN.

The UN Human Rights Council just passed a consensual resolution with much stricter language than any other has ever had. It doesn't mean that it can impose anything: it is not a state and has no army.

What it does mean, is that the Tatmadaw no longer enjoys the same level of support from China it did until the coup. 

And this is a pretty major change on the international side of things.",24,0,1616964988.0,AllAlongTheParthenon,neutral

When the military was committing genocide against the Rohingya people,  **Aung San Suu Kyi** was silent, and denied it. The people on Myanmar were silent and took no action.

Now YOU are the ones that are being shot and killed. How do you feel now that it is happening to you? Do you wish you had stood up for justice and peace when it was only the Rohingya being murdered? Do you now realize the pain they felt? Can you feel empathy now?

I hope the military Junta are destroyed and sent to jail, but i also hope that the people of Myanmar can self reflect. I hope in the future they can stand up for justice for ALL of Myanmar's people.

The IMF more or less said they know the money's gone and nothing they can do about it.
