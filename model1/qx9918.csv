And people like me who can't take a fucking joke. 

This post is clearly a joke, but I find it disturbing with how you see the current situation in Myanmar. It's not even worth joking about.

Yes, it's not as bad as the other countries like Afghanistan. But still, to put such a time and effort into this ""joke"" is unbelievable. Even if you didn't create this, sharing it here is no better.
