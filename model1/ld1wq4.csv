t1_gm46yz7,gm478oz,A lot of propaganda and ignorance. Many of the supporters have ties to the military such as family or close friends. And there's reason to believe some vids are infact staged by the military (although ofc there is no evidence).,10,5,1612534453.0,flabbajacks,negative

t1_gm478oz,gm4p6nr,"So if I have a different view than you I'm ignorant and under the influence of propaganda. Doesn't propaganda make you believe in others like that? Sounds ironic and hypocritical to me. In democracy whether you like the other's view or not you still have to respect it. For example, just because republicans have a different view doesn't mean they are ignorant. If you can't respect other's views then you are no different than the tyrant and far from being a democracy.",0,6,1612542166.0,ewwwy,negative

t1_gm4p6nr,gm4yzqg,"I agree that people should have the rights to support who they want.  They have the right to vote for who they want. What's happened now is the military has taken away the people's power to vote. Effectively stripping the power away from the people. What they did is the most anti-democratic thing possible. People who support this, are of course anti-democratic.",6,7,1612546265.0,flabbajacks,neutral
t1_gm4p6nr,gm51drv,Yes in democracy people have the right to choose who they want to support. But carrying out a coup and supporting it is no longer a democracy. So yeah. Know the difference,5,7,1612547260.0,gamegeek25,neutral

t1_godg9qg,godhulm,I respect your opinion fully. I am actually a citizen from Yangon. But you need to understand that in democracy even if there is opposition you must respect their views regardless of emotions.,2,8,1614022605.0,ewwwy,neutral

t1_godi2dz,godi8us,Then the votes must be properly investigated without bias and determine who is wrong and right. But that is not the case at hand.

t1_godirm1,godjve3,"They did it accordingly to the constitution. They enacted 144 of the criminal penal code and martial law which means that ordinary civil laws do not apply and all laws are made by the military as needed. 

I understand that most people in this subreddit don't like being arrested for no reason. But if 144 enacted people can not be in groups of more than 5  during the day and there is a curfew at night. This is the law. Regardless of emotions as citizens we are responsible for any action.",0,3,1614023493.0,ewwwy,neutral
t1_godjve3,godkl0g,"Watch this and listen closely to what the chinese say to the protestors. 
Now look at this article and see what the military has said would happen if people protested. They said ""It is found that the protesters have raised their incitement towards riot and anarchy mob on the day of 22 February. Protesters are now inciting the people, especially emotional teenagers and youths, to a confrontation path where they will suffer the loss of life,”
There was no riot, nothing else besides the police using live ammo against peaceful protestors.  As you will see these types of threats were made to chinese student protestor in 1989. It is eerily similar.
