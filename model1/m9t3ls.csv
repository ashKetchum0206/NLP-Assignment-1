Looking at top weibo discussions, you won't find anything about China government reponse on it.

The second post is blaming George Soros supporting the protest as a evidence the west is behide the protest.

A lot of them are putting the blame on the protesters and related it to Hong Kong about ""The west is behind it to creates chaos!""

It said ""Myanmar detains Soros-linked group, so Soro must be supporting the protest. Which is a proof the US is creating chaos in Myanmar like Hong Kong, and trying to attack china!""
