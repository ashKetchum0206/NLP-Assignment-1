t3_lz10do,gpzg4tg,"Honest advice...tighten the shield wall, especially in the middle.  What made the Roman shield walls so effective was how tight they were.  Plus, overlap will help some areas be better protected against small arms fire.  Also, if you want I would suggest practicing moving as one whole unit.  That will give you protection whilst being mobile.  A chant or some form of rhythmic grunting/noise can help keep everyone in sync.  Moving a shield wall like that as one whole group will require that as a metronome of sorts. 

I'd love to hear from anyone with better experience on how you can outfit their shields against bullets and not weigh them down.",24,0,1615050443.0,None,neutral

The military won't stop, they will keep killing until they achieved their goals and if necessary abolish democracy forever. You need to arm yourself, build groups, do guerilla like warfare. Destroy their equipment, go in the night and ambush their artillery and leave again, do this all the time, this will make the military withdraw as their equipment is vital for their success. Go military yourself in small groups, while keeping up the peaceful protests, but destroy their morality at night. Wound soldiers from afar with slingshots so their morale gets destroyed and so on.

t3_lz10do,gsxdoou,"Not a strategist or anything, so take whatever said with a grain of salt.

Wouldn't those shield be worse? When a bullet hits one, the metal ripped apart and sends metal scraps towards the shield holder. If the military or police uses a shotgun, that's even worse because now you have metal shards along with it. 

It'll work on polices without guns, but I'm not sure if it's better if they have guns. 

What they need to do is not to fight head on. It's hard to win head on if you don't have guns and your enemies have way superior weapons. Brute forcing would result in a lot of death.

The alternative way would be to use guerrilla tactics, It doesn't matter if the tactics is petty either. You fighting a military dictatorship, use everything in your power to achieve your goal.

They need to use some kind of pepper-spray projectiles, even if it's primitive. Pepper powder should be accessible. (I don't know if this would work but maybe pepper powder covered in cloth? so when thrown it sort of explodes?)

For range, perhaps a slingshot or a sling could help. Mix that with some kind of pepper projectiles and hurl them towards the enemy.

Bows would work, but are difficult to make. Especially the arrow part as I assume that only arrows with a metal head could pierce modern armor vest.

Avoiding direct combat is probably the best choice as well, or there will be too much casualties. 

The other way would be to use cruel tactics. Somehow poison the polices or military water and food supply, use loud speakers (if you get one) and play loud gun firing sounds at nights to keep them mentally drained, and etc.",2,0,1617206247.0,Massepic,negative

The formation also had very little offensive capabilities to counter a charge or hold out in a melee.

Real bullets or even just stun grenades would likely break it very quickly and because of its relatively complicated nature it would be difficult to reorganise it under duress.

I was referring to flanking and APC faced by the protestors and shield in general military use. Military probably can use a true bullet resistant shield in niche situations like gunshields on mounted MGs on vehicles or a smaller shield attached to a rifle or MG that allows the user to be more protected when firing aimed shots over covers or from a prone position. Currently, without such protection, troops pinned down by automatic fire can only return aimed fire while exposing their face, throat, and head. Often, they are suppressed if the fire is accurate. With a shield attached to a rifle or MG that exposes only a small slit for sights, sufficiently motived troops can actually fire back somewhat.
