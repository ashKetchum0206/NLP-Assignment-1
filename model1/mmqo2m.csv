t1_gtthu0s,gttxjb1,"Maybe you guys are a bit too close to China and that makes Murica scared to intervene. Or maybe they just have yet to discover anything of worth from your nation? 

Like come on. They will definitely go there and help you if they can find something that is worth all the risk of coming all the way to your nation like strategic geo-political locations or fine and dandy resources, such as black gold. And speaking of risk, yes that’s a lot of risks that can attract even more unwanted consequence and I dare not imagine what bad things can come due to foreign intervention.

Look, salvation and freedom doesn’t come free. There is always a hidden cost behind any seemingly righteous act. It is better that you find your own way of solving the bloody puzzle which is tragically difficult. 

Also, the UN? When was the last time the UN managed to end a war with nothing saved for peacekeepers and public denouncement anyway? Don’t expect much help from UN either. They can do something for you but that something won’t change the tide of the struggle.

Nevertheless, good luck. You will soon understand the cruelty of this world and that knowledge can either strike your morale down or empower your will to a greater extent.",7,1,1617901705.0,The_Honkai_Scholar,negative

t1_gtuutm6,gtwznob,"I'm British and would like to mention that a good portion of us aren't imperialist idiots. The situation in Myanmar is about democracy and freedom, the right for the people to lead through their own elected representatives without foreign interference, from my point of view, this has more to do with America than Britain. 

Admittedly, if Myanmar was in the commonwealth help *might* come from Canada, U.K., New Zealand etc and the commonwealth is much more chill now (allowing republics and stuff), but when Myanmar left republics weren't allowed, there were likely more reasons to leave (not that that isn't reason enough) but I'm definitely not well read on the history of Myanmar.

Also (assuming this guy is a nationalist), he probably supports Brexit. One of the main ""attractive"" points of Brexit is more independence from a group of many nations that some say doesn't give us enough freedom (the EU is better than the commonwealth of the 40s and Britain used to be able to vote through Members of European Parliament).",2,1,1617965124.0,Dogtor-Watson,neutral
