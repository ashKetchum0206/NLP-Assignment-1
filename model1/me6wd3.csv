Original comment

This post is getting attention in this sub. I just want to tell anyone who is sorting by hot that the situation this Saturday (March 27th, 2021) is pretty bad right now. Almost all major cities are being shot at and the death count was 20 this noon.

It is likely we will see more deaths. There are many videos and photos being shared on Twitter now. Much of them can be seen if you sort by news of this subreddit.

If anyone from within the country is seeing this, I urge you to be as safe as possible. It's disgraceful that the army celebrates Armed Force Day by killing many people across many different cities.",37,0,1616825321.0,Quack_Not_Found,negative

t1_gslwejh,gsoa1ay,"Since when is Myanmar a superpower? There's a very obvious difference between intervening in World Wars where there is a very clear and real threat of global expansion, and military intervention in problems contained in specific countries all over the world. 

>You don’t think we should have gotten Saddam Hussain?

No, neither does anyone who has any comprehension of the effects that invading Iraq and Afghanistan have had. Suggest you do some reading on what led to 9/11 in the first place, or the effect that US intervention has had on countless countries over the last 70 years. 

>You think this would still be America today or communist Germany...???

*This* is the internet. Not everyone on Reddit is American or clueless enough to believe in the world police bullshit. 

>You don’t think life is worth saving??

What's your plan then, flying over to Myanmar and asking them politely? Are you genuinely this naive? How many dead civilians does the US and its allies have on their hands from ""saving lives"" in every corner of the globe over the last several decades?

Of course I agree minorities are treated differently than whites. America is full of racism. But you're higher than me if you think American cops are walking around and killing children, shooting into houses, starting fires, torturing, decapitating, and cutting internet and data.
