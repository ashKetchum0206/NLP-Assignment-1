Do nothing, and let the Burmese deal with their own government and make their peace. You can't make peacekeepers be more willing to shoot; for they will eventually become yet another party to the unending conflict which will go on forever. Someone will have to occupy Burma for 60 years. Germany and Japan have been occupied by the US armed forces since 1945!

War has a function: it destroys itself and make people realize the limits to their power. Once they are utterly exhausting and have lost everything, they would make *lasting peace*. [How war can bring peace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTTruD9WTvc&t=1s).

If you are really worry about China this or that, do it in the most ruthless geopolitical way possible and that is a brutal proxy war. Once both sides have burned out their desires to make war (because their children are dead), they will make peace.

If you want to do something, then accept and *resettle* refugees. Don't warehouse and keep them in refugee camps where, like the Palestinian refugee camps, there are now fourth generation refugees born in the camp. That is madness.

If you really read about the Rwanda genocide, there was a Hutu radio station that called for the murder of the Tutsis everyday, publicly. In that situation, any reasonable Tutsis would have fled the country or at least congregate into a reasonable compact mass so they can fight back better (the genocide was done more with machetes than with bullets).

The UN ""peacekeepers"" arrived that promised to protect them so they didn't leave. The ""peacekeepers"" made it much, much worse. And then they stood by and watched the genocide unfolding.
