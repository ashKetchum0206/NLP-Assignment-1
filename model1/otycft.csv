t3_otycft,h7ahb5l,"This all happened because of the military. If there were no coup, we will not need to protests and the people(the protesters,the medical student,civillian,.....) will not die with the shot of military.They will be with their family right now working for their future. The covid will not spread like this.  If the military didn't ordered the oxygen, oxygen supplies shop and clinic not to sell to the people, the people will not die because of lacking Oxygen. And now the military is still killing and arresting the doctors who help the people. Our people are doing this for our country.We will never give up.FIGHTING!!!",2,0,1627803242.0,yanario1,negative

t3_otycft,h6yznug,"I know I'm probably gonna get a lot of hate for saying this, but protests/gatherings while Covid is spreading so fast and having an extremely high fatality rate is probably not the smartest idea. Especially when the junta is deliberately trying to cut off aid for covid patients. This is exactly what they want. Spread more covid and chaos among the population so that there is no one left to fight them later on.",-12,0,1627575528.0,CorvoDravnoz,negative

t1_h6yznug,h6z7kr6,"They are protesting outside, all masked up, the crowd size is relatively small and they are not exactly standing body to body. These types of protests also tend to last only for several minutes. Considering all that, I think the fear that these protests spreading COVID is greatly exaggerated.

For what it is worth, I don't think there is anything to suggest that the much, much larger protests in February and even March were correlated with massive transmission of COVID. And those protests involved hundreds of thousands if not millions with demonstrations going on for hours with little to no social distancing. 

These protests have a lot of symbolic value and are big morale boosters for many people.",14,1,1627578753.0,VikingJoseph,neutral
t1_h6yznug,h708y5r,"I understand that thought. Consider this however, to them maybe, the removal of the human rights and the slaughtering sand kidnappings are worse than COVID. The fight for Freedom is something that requires sacrifices, and they seem to agree that at least for everyone there, fighting for Justice and Freedom is more important than staying healthy.

I respect your thoughts still! I hope you understand this different perspective",13,1,1627594239.0,wehadathing-inspace2,neutral
t1_h6yznug,h6z9j1v,"Yap. But they protest because if we don't protest , the military will have more longer time to kill the people. If our country is in the hand of the military for one day, we will lose our people more than 10 each day. If we protest and we win 1day earlier, we can save 10 people. I know we cannot win immediately as we protest. But that protest with the hopes of ""will this protest make us win 1 day earlier"". Even if we don't protest because of covid, we will die because of their bullets and lack of oxygen.  Whenever our people is doing for our country. I hope we will always be united.Fighting! 👊",8,1,1627579537.0,yanario1,negative
t1_h6yznug,h6z2w9i,"That is exactly what I thought when I see this video. As a member of the family who is suffering from Covid, it is so hopeless when you are trying to find oxygen. That goddamn awesome Government hospital didn't accept the Covid patient with a SpO2 levels lower than 90. Even when we wanted to admit the patient to the hospital, that so-called private hospital and Government hospital asked the signs of the local resident. Luckily, my family members didn't get to that point and sought online consultation. I mean I understand that the protest should carry on. But not this way. I know I will get downvoted for saying this, but it was like ""They are helping the junta indirectly to succeed in their plans"". In this time, your safety is public safety.",2,1,1627576850.0,Vicky3091O,negative
t1_h6z9oa0,h6zoka3,"Maybe downtown near Sule Pagoda or by The Strand? Those really tall buildings are new since I lived there. At first I thought by 19th Street, but that area would be too packed for this crowd.

t1_h6z7kr6,h6z9lyf,"You ought to know that just by donning a mask you don't become instantly immune to covid. I was in the protests in February as well and there were a lot of unmasked people. I believe these protests are a super spreader event for covid. I'm not saying not to protest, I fucking hate the junta with all my heart. But I have lost 3 of my relatives in 2 weeks to covid, and my grandpa was covid positive (luckily he pulled through thank god).  Almost everyone I'm acquainted with have all lost loved ones to covid in these recent days. What makes this even scarier is that there is lack of healthcare personnels and the junta is fucking up all medical infrastructures. Not to mention that this variant of covid has an extremely high infection and fatality rate. Better to be alive and low morale to fight another day than high morale but dead.",7,2,1627579570.0,CorvoDravnoz,negative
t1_h6z2w9i,h6z7r2a,"Yeah my main concern is by doing this, the junta hopes to kill more people indirectly by using covid as a weapon. Even if it does not kill the young people protesting, the virus will spread and kill the elderly. As an analogy, covid would be the bullet and the protestors would be the gun the junta is using to kill people.",3,2,1627578825.0,CorvoDravnoz,negative

t1_h6z9lyf,h6zemjb,"As far as I know the blm protests in the US, for example, didn't correlate with any jump in covid cases. Since these protests are done with masks, relatively small crowd sizes and (from what I can see) with some distance in between the individual protesters, I don't think that it's very dangerous",7,3,1627581602.0,bluwubewwy,neutral
t1_h6z9lyf,h6zai3d,"I never said that donning a mask makes you immune to COVID. I listed many other reasons why your fears of these protests being superspreading events are not justified, almost everyone wearing masks in this video were just one of them. And my mention of masks being worn is regarding the protest in this video, not about the protests in February. There is little evidence to suggest the protests in February were some superspreading event as case counts did not explode until months later well after the mass protests. The third wave also started to grow exponentially first in Chin and western Sagaing, which you would expect it to start in places like Mandalay and Yangon if the massive protests truly were super spreader events like you fear. 

I am sorry for your losses. I have plenty of Myanmar friends that also were sick with COVID or lost their own family members of friends. But there is little to no evidence to suggest your fears of these protests being super spreader events are justified.",0,3,1627579933.0,VikingJoseph,negative
t1_h6zor52,h705yl9,"Hong Kong people decided to stop demonstrating for COVID reasons (among others) and now it's almost a forgotten  movement on the international media. Now people are just getting arrested and going to jail as part of the new law. The movement was huge, probably still is, but I think it lost its momentum due to this precaution. On one side life's get lost on the other also, so what is the best way to go? Maybe it's their choice. I hope the best for the people in Myanmar.",4,3,1627592954.0,Sensation-sFix,negative

t1_h6zemjb,h6zfu4z,"I'm more of the skeptical and careful sort. I know it's a controversial take but the blm protests may have contributed somewhat to the spread of covid in America. Same goes for protests in Myanmar as well. I believe it's better to be safe than sorry, especially given the state the medical infrastructure in Myanmar is in. I'm not saying not to protest, but it's probably the best to find other creative ways to protest that doesn't involve going out in person. This is just my opinion. I want my countrymen to be alive and well.",2,4,1627582106.0,CorvoDravnoz,neutral
t1_h6zemjb,h6zgz53,"That's difference. Because as far as I know, there is no huge outbreak during the BLM protest in America and that's huge outbreak we called it as wave. Virus is spreading and the strains is different from others. In the first two waves, we didn't have that kind of oxygen demand like we are having now. It is much more transmissible than the other two waves we were having. Besides, I believe most of these people are not vaccinated. I am not saying we shouldn't protest but not this time (especially in populated city like Yangon) where healthcare is a nightmare right now.",2,4,1627582577.0,critic300191,neutral
t1_h6zai3d,h6zbg1x,"I understand and thanks my friend. I'm just afraid for the people of Myanmar. Covid is stupid scary these days, even relatively healthy people are succumbing to it in mere days. I think the reason covid wasn't big headlines after the coup was either due to suppression by the junta or because of low detection rate. It might have mutated during those months and is now even more infectious and deadly than ever. I feel like during these times it's best to be as safe as possible especially due to lack of medical care. We really don't know what we are dealing with.",1,4,1627580310.0,CorvoDravnoz,negative

t1_h6zbg1x,h6ze2vi,"I understand. It is hard not to be on edge these days given all that is happening. What probably happened in my opinion is the Delta strain from India probably entered Myanmar a few months ago. Which makes sense why Chin and western Sagaing regions were the first areas that saw a massive surge of infections due to their proximity to India.
