t3_qejj13,hhw1uw8,"For all of those clicking this thread and feeling horrified by seeing police being shot, here are key things you need to know:

The police of Myanmar are not like a normal police force that in theory answer to local and higher civilian authorities. The Myanmar police are essentially another wing of the military apparatus. The head of the Myanmar police is Than Hlaing, a member of the military who holds the rank of lieutenant-general. He has been implicated in the brutal suppression of the protests and also is going to lead a bloody offensive against resistance groups in Northwest Myanmar. The Myanmar police answer to the Ministry of Home Affairs which is controlled by another general. And of course this general answers to Min Aung Hlaing, the leader of the junta. This was even true during the days of semi-civilian rule- the civilian government never controlled the police force.

The police of Myanmar have long been a crucial force in arresting, torturing, killing and imprisoning dissidents. They took part in the brutal crackdowns of protesters in the early days of the uprising. The police stand side by side with the core military in ""clearance"" operations against ethnic armed groups. The distinction between the police and military is a meaningless one.

t1_hhu5at0,hhvgmcn,"""The soldier/police officer had no choice"" literally applies to any conflict whether it is World War II or an asymmetrical conflict like the one in Myanmar. Whether the soldier or police is ""just following orders"" is irrelevant- at the end of the day, they work for a security apparatus that is dedicated to protecting the regime's power and crushing any dissent. If the vast majority of police and military refused to work for the junta from the get go, this situation would not be happening. Until they choose to desert or defect, they are 100% fair game to be attacked.

Regarding only shooting when being in a confrontation, that is pretty ridiculous. The Myanmar military and police routinely attack indiscriminately and being purely on the defensive would put PDF at a major disadvantage. What you are advising is essentially asking PDFs and civilians to wait until it is too late to defend themselves. You can try to equate all you want the attacks of PDF and the junta but the truth is that indiscriminately attacking civilians/protesters with heavy firepower is far, far different than making surgical attacks against soldiers and police. Burmese spent weeks demonstrating peacefully and then the military decided to murder hundreds of protesters anyways. It took a little over eight months since the coup before ASEAN decided to take more severe action against the regime.

t1_hhvmxen,hhyoyj4,"Since you seem to actually be serious, I will go ahead and bite and respond.

To put it in perspective, this uprising in Myanmar started off completely peaceful. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, took to the streets and people overwhelmingly tried their best to not commit any violent acts against the police and military. People went on strike to join the Civil Disobedience Movement. Demonstrators were giving flowers and water to police and soldiers and were begging them to stand for the people. Do you know what happened? Soldiers and the same police you feel sad about dying launched a vicious crackdown. Security forces open fired with live ammunition against peaceful protesters, killing hundreds and injuring far more. Thousands of activists and protesters were thrown in prison and some imprisoned ended up being tortured to death. Women have been sexually assaulted. People were literally set on fire by the junta's forces. 

Even in spite of this violence, Burmese people tried to respond with self-defensive measures like building barricades, wearing helmets, using shields and only throwing things like Molotov cocktails if the soldiers and police responded with more violence. The junta continued to just indiscriminately and disproportionately slaughter more protesters. The military laid siege to entire neighborhoods. Soldiers would come dead in the night and abduct an activist, only to return his corpse in the morning. Despite all of this, very little police and soldiers defected at that point.

As the dictatorship escalated its use of violence and murder against its own people, that is finally when Myanmar people started to organize themselves in militia and guerrilla groups to resist the military through armed resistance. And so you started to get the bombings, assassinations and shootings like you see in this video. And you know what has happened since since the start of armed resistance? More and more soldiers and police have deserted the regime. The civil administration of the junta has collapsed in large swathes of the country because of the threat of retribution by PDF groups but also to show their opposition to the military. The resistance groups have managed to inflict heavy casualties against the military. And because of this and the huge unpopularity of the military, the number of soldiers and police the junta has is steadily declining.

Killing the ""softest targets"" does in fact serve a purpose. It overstretches the military as they have to commit resources into cities like Yangon and Mandalay rather than using all of their troops to crush resistance in the hinterlands. It gives more incentive for security forces to defect as they know longer can feel that sticking with the junta as the safest option for their wellbeing. It prevents the regime from fully consolidating its power. And all signs so far points to the strategy of armed resistance the pro-democracy groups have employed as working. 

And no, I don't think you can claim ""a drive-by shooting is still a drive-by shooting"". The circumstances of this shooting and general armed resistance in Myanmar is far different than the ones in developed countries and even many developing countries. These police aren't like the police in most of Europe and the US where they answer directly to civilian administration. The police are essentially a wing of the military as they report directly to the generals an Min Aung Hlaing, even during the previous semi-civilian administration. Myanmar police have long participated in destroying dissent as it is part of their job as their literal employer is the junta. Police have even fought alongside the military in wars against ethnic armed organizations. Police are not some innocent bystanders as you seem to think they are. 

And you know why some Burmese celebrate these killings? Because since the coup, and honestly decades of brutal military misrule, the hated military is finally on the receiving end of violence. Burmese people spent the last eight and half months watching people they care about being beaten and killed in the streets. Many streets in Yangon, Mandalay and other cities were literally stained with blood from the massacres the military and police inflected against protesters and the population as a whole.

If you don't have enough knowledge about my country, please refrain from commenting. The Tatmadaw, when they broke up the mass protests, i.e. shoot at innocent protesters, basically went around arresting anyone they ""suspect"" to be a protester. 

You're young and wearing a pair of jeans? Arrested. You're just young? Arrested. Just feel like it? Arrested. Many of these people who were arrested languished in prison for months on end because of some power-hungry generals desperately wanted to hold onto that power.

Last week, just before the ""amnesty"", in Mandalay, junta forces drove a car into a protest, injuring and arresting many. Their sole crime? Protesting. In the same week, they arrested and murdered innocent villagers and looted and burned down their villages as per their ""4 Cuts"" strategy. They are called ""military dogs"" for a reason, mate. They are as mad as rabid dogs that must be put down.

I was not able to find verified numbers for defections from non-propaganda sources. Even from the propaganda sources, the maximum I could see is approximately 3,300 defections out of 549,000. That's 0.6%. Also, to breakdown that number, there were already 2,500 prior to the armed uprising. That's roughly 357 per month. With the armed uprising, there are about 476 unverified defections per month. So my question to you is, even if the number is real, is the 119 defections per month worth giving up the moral and political advantage the movement had prior to use of violence?

With regards to the switch to the armed movement, it seems very immature and irrational, considering the lack of resources the uprising has. I believe there is massive propaganda from both sides of the conflict to make claims of their limited victories into something that's way more than it is. Remember that social media creates an echo chamber of tribalism. The movement would benefit from taking a step back and see the situation from a different light before it squanders all the assets it has.
