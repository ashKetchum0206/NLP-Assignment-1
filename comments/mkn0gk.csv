t3_mkn0gk,gtsfekk,"There seems to be a narrative on this sub that China was behind the coup, which makes no sense to me. The military did the coup to get rid of the democratic government, sure the generals don't have a horrible relationship with China but neither does  Aung San Suu Kyi. The last thing China wants is instability on it's border it makes no sense that China would greenlight a coup.",2,0,1617872885.0,Darzin_

t1_gtj8htq,gto68f1,"I vividly recall when a Myanmar citizen born to Chinese or ethnic Chinese in Myanmar got shot, Reddit was celebrating “because China had it coming”.

t1_gtsfekk,gtsj9o0,Wrong. Suu Kyi was incredibly close to Beijing— so close the Tatmadaw needed to step in and force her to withdraw from a few projects. No way Beijing would back a group of people that has been historically against them.,1,1,1617876196.0,None

If the anti-military dictatorship people did this— “ha, China had it coming!”

t1_gto35ag,gto4naz,"Stop repeating that “they hate us because they hate freedom” bullshit. 

China got blamed for supporting the coup when every serious scholar knows the Tatmadaw hates Beijing; and even if Beijing is behind all of these, the murders and arsons against Chinese expats, ethnic Chinese, and Chinese businesses were also enough for them to hate your “peaceful protest”.",6,2,1617787936.0,None
