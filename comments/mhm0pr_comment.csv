t3_mhm0pr,gszz227,Anyone know how well armed the minority ethnic military groups are? Seems one of the biggest struggles would be arming civilians if a civil war kicks off. Do the minority ethnic groups have supply lines for weapons outside of Myanmar? Just curious if there’s even a chance the people’s will can prevail.

t1_gszvubo,gszzo5z,"That's what makes me so sad and makes it seem so helpless at times. This isn't like many dictatorships who are ELECTED by people desperate for change and lied to. 

This is a pure seizure of power by armed thugs. There aren't people rallying behind them, believing they'll improve the country, it's the absolute opposite. All of us all over the world KNOW they have to be removed, but they've denied the democratic process. 

I know it's always complicated, but either the un or some coalition HAS to step in. There's no democracy left for the people of myanmar.",19,1,1617254425.0,Onagasaki
t1_gszvubo,gt0bpkf,"I don't really see that a return to the 2008 constitution is possible, though. If the CRPH wins, there's no way that they're going to allow the military to retain such a huge amount of power - in fact, they're going to want to weaken the Tatmadaw as much as possible. Conversely, if the Tatmadaw wins, they're going to try and cement their power in perpetuity even more, and ensure that a political party can't just win 60% of the vote and get enough seats to overrule the combined seats held by the military.

The current constitution is going to be abolished whichever side wins.",9,1,1617265312.0,Temeraire64

I’m an ignorant American who knows nothing of the culture or history of the region so the more clarification the better if it’s not too much to ask. Just appalled seeing the slaughter happening in Myanmar an curious and hopeful the people have a chance. Funny how the UN is all about protecting “democracy” and “the people” until there’s a situation where they could actually do so. I do understand the geopolitical sensitivity with China being so close though so it’s a tight rope act at this point supplying aid. How much of the population is made up of Bamar groups vs the ethnic minority militias? Was it the Bamar people actually cooperating with the Junta or just being stuck between a rock and a hard place? The majority of Americans don’t like the war in the Middle East, that doesn’t stop the military from continuing to occupy it, yet people assume all Americans have imperial idealizations.",1,2,1617295333.0,NEFgeminiSLIME

t1_gt1qdao,gt2e6a6,"No, I really don't think real unity is possible. The only somewhat unifying force in the country right now is hatred for the military. And even then, most Bamar actually supported the military's campaign against the ethnic minorities at heart.  remember Rohingya for example? They dismissed all the ethnic minorities struggles as rebellion and wanting to secede when in reality, the ethnic minorities felt betrayed by the Bamar after agreeing to a union with equal footing in the Panlong Agreement.

&#x200B;

A Myanmar with 9 main ethnic groups is a British invention. It's only possible that these vastly different cultures and ethnicities (each with different values, attitudes, and agendas) comprise a single country if they were coerced into it, which is the case here.

Even Chin National Front warned them to leave Chin state. ""Doesn't interfere"" my ass LOL. Why tf are they in Paletwa then haha
