t3_reha4v,ho8djw8,"She's a nurse,
She is pregnant,

And yes, they both are supporters of USDP; the party which sides with military (it's actually the military themselves)

They are on their way back from the hospital,
They are stopped by the military soldiers,

Why do they stop them?
Cause there's been attacks in similar fashion from PDFs,
where they shoot the soldiers from motorcycles.
Unfortunately, the couple didn't stop, and drove pass them.
Which made the soldiers suspect them as PDFs,
Thus shooting them both.
It's very sad to see them brutally killed in front of an hospital. 
There are several sources but I will only put one [source](https://www.facebook.com/102986271923475/posts/246004410954993/) on here since the preservatives are not much different.

Personally I don't think PDFs killed the women since she's pregnant. Sooner or later a much more reliable source, like video or CCTV footage will surface.
And we will know who exactly did that.",17,0,1639304674.0,Tasha_GodSpell

t1_hoc9y9m,hocclgt,"Not everyone who takes part in the Silent Strike agrees with murdering people. Not every NLD supporter agrees with the PDF and their killing sprees. Not even Aung San Suu Kyi would support this if she had any say in current NUG politics. Aung San Suu Kyi is the reason the NLD got so many votes in 2020. Myanmar people voted for the NLD under Aung San Suu Kyi. They didn't vote for the PDF.

What has happened to the ""democratic opposition"" would sadden her immensely and she would never stand for things like killing families just because they don't take part in the CDM and are therefore labelled Dalan. In 1988 when there was also an exile government Aung San Suu Kyi never supported them. After 1988 Aung San Suu Kyi also spoke out against killing civilian military supporters. The things happening today are the very same things Aung San Suu Kyi always disagreed with. You can read about that history easily, it's available online.

The PDF boasts about killing people who they have decided to be Dalan. You can't pride yourself with killing people and then claim you are not actually killing people. 

Even though it doesn't seem like it there are actually a lot of people in Myanmar who are against killings. Buddhist teachings are also totally incompatible with what is going on. No one who claims to be a Buddhist can participate in these things.

By the way, even if there were emplacements at this place, that still doesn't mean that any military/police was present.

The fact is: The victims were USDP members. The woman was pregnant. They were shot by two guys on a motorbike. They were shot with an American gun using American bullets typically used by the PDF.

t1_hocmnfl,hocv19j,"It's part of the Buddhist eightfold patch not to kill. There are no ifs and buts. The Buddha also didn't say it's ok to kill if you are engaging in politics. The junta claims to promote Buddhist values but everyone knows that's hypocrisy but the same can also be said about the PDF.

There are many problems about the PDF killing Dalans. They act as executioners and judges at the same time. Whenver that happens human rights violations occur. Human rights do not only apply to NLD supporters you know? They apply to everyone. 

Aung San Suu Kyi has been cut off from any communications. There were rumours about her not allowing the NUG and CRPH to use the name of the NLD. Which would seem plausible to me as she also didn't agree with the exile government (National Coalition Government of Burma) after the 1990 elections either. 

I am very sure that if she knew about the PDF's actions she would not agree with them. Her political strategy has always been non-violence. 

No, I don't believe in the NUG and PDF. The reason for that is I don't think violence is going to solve the problem. By killing foot soldiers and policemen the PDF increases the hatred the average Tatmadaw member has against the democratic opposition. Imagine for a second you were a Tatmadaw soldier patrolling the streets and you would be in constant fear of getting blown up or shot by some guy on a motorbike. If we are honest this constant fear will only increase your hatred and even if you were sympathetic to the NUG before you might change your mind and start hating them instead.

The past months have also shown that the PDF will never be able to actually defeat the Tatmadaw on the battlefield. All these attacks really don't have any positive outcome. You can kill 10.000 Tatmadaw soldiers and you will still achieve nothing but more suffering. It's simply pointless and not working. 

Due to social media many people in Myanmar have become incredibly radicalized over the months. There is no way to discuss anything rationally. You either support the PDF or they want to see you dead. Both sides are stuck in their echo chambers and can't think rationally while at the same time being influenced by political elites. So many lives are lost for no reason. And you can bet the ones on top of the food chain get richer every day. And that is for both sides, the NUG leaders getting donations from around the world and Min Aung Hlaing and his friends enriching themselves by treating Myanmar as their personal treasure chest.

I can only appeal please start thinking rationally and remember basic human principles. Stop this hateful mob-thinking non-sense. Stop swearing every time someone disagrees with you. Being irrational and hot-headed has never led anyone to success.",2,7,1639383288.0,None

If it was PDF they will have to pay the price of the death of baby in the stomach in a way.
They did a sloppy job. They should have been carefull with the condition of their targets.
I might need to explain why they could potentially be targets. They could have reported the peaceful protesters to the Junta. And they could have been actively still reporting to junta.
But that doesn't justify the killing of the baby in her stomach. And thus they should be held accountable.
