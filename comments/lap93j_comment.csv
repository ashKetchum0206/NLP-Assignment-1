He was credited with finding loopholes in the 2008 Constitution of Myanmar and in particular with creating the office of state counsellor, which enabled Aung San Suu Kyi to become the de facto head of government in 2016.[6] He advocated constitutional change in Myanmar,[7] believing that the 2008 Constitution, which was drafted by the military, should be replaced and not merely amended.

t1_glpika3,glwwxc7,"Military gangraped and massacred Rohingya people. It is no secret and it is true. What they did was not for pleasure but for systemic ethnic cleansing. However, ASSK has no responsibility because she has no power over Military.

As for why Military did those, it is for 2 reasons:

1) Military hates Rohingya people and they want to scare them so they run away completely.

2) They want to cause politic instability in Myanmar and tarnish ASSK's reputation in the international community.

If you ask me if we condone rape and murder, not really. Buddhists are pacificts and our precepts are crystal clear. Two of them are: ""we shall not rape,"" and ""we shall not kill"". If you betray these oaths, after you swore them, you are punished in hell. If you do those even without oaths, you still suffer karmic retribution. So no, we don't like that. ASSK is the same.

However, the entirety of Myanmar have neutral, dislike, and hate relationship with Rohingya people. To understand that, you need to know there are 4 categories of Rohingya people.

1st category - descendants of Muslim merchants from 1000 years ago.

2nd category - descendants of working slaves for railway projects during the British colonial era. 

3rd category - descendants of Muslim population India pleaded us to temporarily take in when they were facing starvation.

4th category - illegal immigrants from Bengladesh through porous borders.

So, among them. We are very fine with the 1st category and they are even an elite class in our country. They are rich and influential.

About the 2nd category, we dislike them because during the world war, they took opposite side to commit genocides on us.

About the 3rd category, we pitied them at that time but it was supposed to be temporary which became permanent because India conveniently forgot about them.

About the 4th category, we hate them with passion because they commit gangrapes and serial killings in broad daylight. About 10 years ago in Rakhine state, before all these clearance operations started, do you know the happenings in there? We have serial murder and rape cases in Rakhine state almost every day because Rohingya population of certain areas outnumber Rakhine population by 1 to 10. Without Mabatha's or Military's interventions, Rakhine ethnics would have been completely annihilated by now.

Mabatha and Military are allies and we dislike both. But they have different goals. Mabatha for instance does not rape. They just kill and look down on rohingya as ugly monsters who threaten peace. They are headed by Extremist Monk Wirathu. However, they are compassionate towards Rakhine ethnics. Military on the other hand just seeks constant benefits. They save Rakhine ethnics to get popularity support. In fact, the Military also rapes and murders Rakhine ethnics so the main victims here are Rakhine ethnics, not just Rohingya people alone. They are the weakest force here.

What happens now...

It is simple. Constitution grants 25% automatic congress seats to Military and you need 75% to change constitution. Military lost all the non-automatic seats so they are afraid of Civilian Government changing the constitution so they took action first by arresting the State Counsellor, the President and all the Congressmen. However, we have two Vice Presidents - one is installed by the Military and the other by Civilian Government.

President was held at gun point and asked to sign the State of Emergency. He rejected, saying they can kill him if they want but he won't sign. So, the Military's Vice President now became Acting President and he issued State of Emergency in the former's place (which is semi-legal) that grants Full Power to Military.

As for ASSK, Military hijacked her account and posted a message that tells every citizen to rise up in arms. Military arrested her under the clause ""Causing Civil Unrest"".

All the Congressmen are also arrested. I think they will be pressured to change the constitution for 50% automatic congress seats for Military.

About the international community, we don't expect much from them. They didn't help us ten years ago and they won't help us this time. As for the reasons, a few weeks ago China's Foreign Minister visited Myanmar. He talked with Military and will use Veto in United Nations to prevent foreign intervention. As for sanctions, they will only hurt the civilians and not Military. For example, if United States bans Myanmar's exports, the civilians will be helpless and unable to do anything. But Military will export them to Thailand, India, China, and perhaps even Russia. So the sanctions hold no effects except destabilising the country further.

^ Situation from a few days ago.

So you know what the Western Media feeds you is propaganda.

But in our country, Mabatha and Military preach ASSK as Muslim Whore because she built good houses for the relocated Rohingya people. By western standards, those houses might look shabby but they are made of concrete. You have to understand that Rakhine ethnics and many other ethnics live in shacks made of dried leaves.

A person can still defend genocide publicly while trying to prevent genocide privately. Moreover, if I were in her situation, I would do the same.

IMO, the Rohingya case was more of a persecution for political reasons rather than a genocide. If we did want a genocide, why the hell would we want to limit it only to Rakhine border.

Although ASSK said that those acts of human right violations will be ""addressed in accordance with strict norms of justice"", her government doesn't have any power over the military yet. It could be military's plan all along to destroy her international reputation so that they would have an easier coup now. 

And yes, there were even some Burmese who said stuff like ""those Rohingya should go back to where they come from"" or just stayed ignorant about that.

Obviously they did, since the military had to murder and rape them to kick them out of the country. Oh and it was the government that denied the Rohingya citizenship in 1982.

If you think you can't win, then perhaps it's time to rethink the approach, one approach I already suggested: ""shut up and find way to survive and subvert the structure from the inside"". This is something I and my family has a lot of experience doing because despite living under a system many may think as intolerable, we have ways.

If you think that doing so is intolerable, then there's always the option of going out in a blaze of glory.

And to point out the simple reality at the strategic level: nobody outside Myanmar with enough leverage to do something will do anything; these are the Japanese and Singaporeans. There are others with no leverage who will pay lip service to the idea that ""this coup is bad, m'kay"".

>Additionally only a few people asked for US military intervention, most are just asking to spread information about this.

Everybody knows it already. It already achieved meme status. So that part is done. Yet like I said, nothing will be done. So, you can find a way to live on, or go out in a blaze of glory. And I'll say that the world's inactivity is justified: Myanmar serves no strategic interest to anyone, nor its people deserve help.",0,7,1612353585.0,SmirkingImperialist
t1_glszkly,gltesqi,"I think your misunderstanding is that the civilian government never had any control or ability to coordinate any military action.  So when the term ""government"" is used, it is an error to equate that to the NLD civilian government which was under ASSK.  Although we would traditionally assume that the elected government would also hold some sway over military, that is decidedly not the case in Burma.  There the Tatmadaw has always acted independently.",3,7,1612320752.0,None
t1_gltesqi,gltib1q,"Not talking about military action at all here, but about the government's own actions. And yes, I know the government is not entirely civilian nor NLD, but it has its own responsibilities and should be held accountable too. That's why you end up with the following in the section on responsibility:

> 93. The constitutional powers of the civilian authorities afford little scope for controlling the actions of the Tatmadaw, nor is there any indication that they participated directly in planning or implementing security operations or were part of the command structure. Nevertheless, nothing indicates that the civilian authorities used their limited powers to influence the situation in Rakhine State where crimes were being perpetrated. The State Counsellor, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has not used her de facto position as Head of Government, nor her moral authority, to stem or prevent the unfolding events, or seek alternative avenues to meet a responsibility to protect the civilian population. On the contrary, the civilian authorities have spread false narratives, denied the wrongdoing of the Tatmadaw, blocked independent investigations (including that of the fact-finding mission), and overseen the destruction of evidence. Through their acts and omissions, the civilian authorities have contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes. 

The crux of the issue regarding the NLD and civilian part of the gov. is the forced permanent relocation of Rohingya through infrastructure projects implemented *after* the Tatmadaw cleared the area. Paragraph 50 says exactly that, and I recall that the extended version of the report goes into a lot more detail. Companies linked to the NLD are also mentioned IIRC.

It may not seem like it, but this is very strong language for a UN-affiliated report.",0,8,1612322475.0,mdsmqlk28

t1_gltstim,glttyen,"I would argue she decided not to use her political capital to press the Tatmadaw on this issue and instead tried to leverage her tacit agreement in exchange for support on the ceasefire agreement and/or constitutional reform. Not very successfully however.

Edit: meant capital, not potential.",1,1,1612328703.0,mdsmqlk28
t1_glttyen,gltxxbd,"I agree that there likely was some attempt at leverage, but I am also doubtful of her political potential if she had decided to oppose the Tatmadaw.  ASSK is very popular in the country, but the Rohyingya issue is a minefield that even she would have had trouble navigating.  

Yes, by not speaking against the military she lost international credibility and the moral high ground, but both those things seemed a necessary trade for potential peace. 

What we witnessed was a clash between the idealized symbol of democratic hope, and a layered politician who found themselves trying to carve out political and economic stability in a deeply traumatized and fractured nation.  

In summary, I believe that the violence in Rhakine was solely engineered by the military.  The civilian government made ineffective attempts at peace, hamstrung by the military.  They did not speak out, especially in the latter parts of the crisis, so as to survive and hopefullyprevent the sad reality we now face. We can say it was immoral to not speak out against persecution, but the truth is a country that has only just caught a glimpse of freedom and security, can only afford to think of its immediate survival.",3,2,1612331171.0,None
