You are just plain utterly wrong.

Gun deaths are high in every country that has prolific gun availability.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate

Having trained and licensed guns available is fine, but just having a right to arms is barbaric and outdated.

If some faction of the army decided to coup when the entire population is *trained* , then the population can fight back, with the help of the rest of the army.

There are 40 million ppl who oppose coup in myanmar but only 400 thousand military personnel.

If even 1% of the anti coup population were in the army with weapons and training then there would be zero chance of a coup being successful

Conscription is not about serving in battle. Its about training, learning to be responsible with those weapons.

Australia has about 27M people. Burma has about 54M people.

These days Burma has massacres of 35 people by lunch time.

Because the people don't have the means to defend themselves.

The US has 7 times as many people as Burma.

While I can imagine the US army shooting 7 * 35 * 7 = 500 American residents day, what I cannot imagine is armed residents of the US not shooting back. And thus I further imagine, the large chunks of the US army going AWOL. And so US army massacres would begin to drop off.

I will gladly take the small risk of a Port Arthur-like massacre over the risk of a Burma-like coup.

Agreed. Just like it would be a disaster if you gave any uneducated and untrained person an automobile.

There is a right to drive an automobile, but the government has the right to require training.
