It’s just a fact that the west view wars and atrocities in the east and south as normal and always has, at least as early as they were committing those atrocities themselves as colonial masters.

Talking about a bunch of countries that have been constantly fighting with each other since before the West was even formed. You're acting like if it wasn't for the West then Africa and the Middle East would be beacons of peace, prosperity and humanity

Please. 

The West could burn to ashes and a hundred years from now the Middle East and Africa are still going to be killing each other for petty reasons.

Blaming the West for all the world's fault is like blaming your parents for all your problems. My guess is you probably do do that. But at some point you need to realize you do bear some responsibility your actions.",1,5,1656424148.0,missingmytowel

It makes sense that places with social strife like you’re describing would be vulnerable to colonial invasion from the west. Spent armies and local rivals put monarchs at huge risk. Weak governments struggle to organize defense.

As a Westerner I see groups like Boko Haram operating throughout Africa and brutalizing their own people

See groups like the Taliban operating throughout the Middle East and brutalizing their own people

I seee governments like Myanmar brutalizing their own people.

I see countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia brutalizing foreign countries.

I see countries like China engaging in Mass enslavement and genocide

You are a westerner who sees the world the way I described, as superior to the east and the south because of something inherent about western people or culture, a view that doesn’t believe history of colonialism shapes the present.  My comment was to say that your worldview is typical in the west.  Your response is to angrily insist you really are better than everyone else. Stfu

Perhaps you’re upset because when you have to say it so plainly your worldview is obviously ethnocentric and biased towards the west. Ignores hundreds of years of European powers stripping people and resources from their colonies.",2,8,1656497848.0,Agreeable_Highway858

Buddy I live in the US. Europe is not my problem. That's like trying to accuse somebody in Japan of China's problems simply because they are also Asia

That's discriminatory as hell you bigot. Limping alll white and Western people into the same pot is racist as fuck too.

All you're trying to do is gloss over how violent and barbarous many parts of the world still are to this day in an effort to show the West as a big bad demon. You seem like the type of person that would hold China on a pedestal just to talk bad about America. Even though they are literally enslaving large groups of people.
