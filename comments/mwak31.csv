t3_mwak31,gvid7wi,"The United States was in a war in Burma from 1944-45. Burma was very divided. Some supported Japan to help kick out the British. Others opposed Japanese occupation. The fighting was savage. 

Every US intervention since 1945 has resulted in almost universal condemnation domestically and abroad. 

I served in Bosnia and OIF. Some muslims thanked me in Bosnia. The Marsh people in Southern Iraq thanked us. Everyone else hated us.

We risk war with China if we go into Burma and it could create a three-way war with India and destabilize Southeast Asia.

Diplomacy is more effective. Our ‘savage wars of peace’ have been a complete disaster. It looks a lot different when you are on the ground overseas.",37,0,1619136982.0,None

t3_mwak31,gvjeyzo,"Well the UN failed the first test,no resolution can be passed in the security council which means no country can intervene in myanmar.

Secondly, you have a military junta which is armed with tanks and fighter jets plus artillery.Removing the junta requires a army stronger or the same to defeat the junta.Even if a country wants to send troops in myanmar, it means a declaration of war. Due to myanmar being a close proximity with China, China would not sit back either .Now you have a proxy war.

Thirdly,countries are struggling with covid -19 which is a more pressing matter domestically that takes greater precedence than myanmar which is a country that they may not have much relations with.

Fourthly,more  sanctions against the junta may not necessarily work. It is only the western side that is putting forth sanctions. However, Asean with its policy of non- interference would not put any sanctions forth. Even if the Asean decided to put sanctions on myanmar,they would be just pushing the junta closer to China.

Hence, the international community can only watch and condemn.",16,0,1619159164.0,Toofargone9999

I can understand that the Burmese are desperate for help from the foreign nations but they don't see the consequences and repercussions of a foreign nation sending its troops into Myanmar.

Three major reasons of not sending troops are :-

1. The conflict can escalate into a military confrontation with China or Russia which might eventually lead to WW3.
2. There is nothing much to gain but more to lose. 
3. The World is suffering from a worldwide pandemic, war will costs a ton of money. The various nations' priority are with its own citizens and not the citizens of a foreign sovereign country.",17,1,1619147931.0,Dumas1108

2. Recognize NUG as the lawful government of Burma.  Turn over all the embassies and consulates of Burma to NUG. 

3. Set up a no fly zone in Burma.  

4. Share satellite telemetry of junta army positions with the Federal Army 

5. Blockade Burma’s ports so that all Burmese naval vessels at sea are stranded until they surrender to the Federal Army and no naval vessels leave port unless under NUG flag.

I know US has already put many sanctions against Myanmar military and companies doing business with the Myanmar military are being taken out of the stock exchange. Not realistic to put sanctions on China as China isn’t directly causing the coup and possibly a bigger reason could be that it would hurt the US economy. Any physical interruption/interaction with the Myanmar army will most likely lead to war. This makes me wonder how likely is the US willing to go to war for Myanmar. How can they justify the cost of deploying military assets and risking American lives? I’d like to hear someone else’s thoughts on this as well.
As an outsider looking at what’s going on, I really hope people could prioritize peace over democracy at this point. Is there anything that can be done to deescalate the situation with the military?
