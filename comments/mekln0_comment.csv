There's some posts made by some of the new mods that explains the situation decently but sadly I can't find them.

Before The Internet took over news coverage, each news agency had a Bureau in most countries, or at least the region. Bureaus were expensive but necessary to get any international news. 

They've largely been eliminated, except for news services (like Reuters), citizen journalists (like reddit and tik tok), and news that's local to that country (often language barriers). Because the internet is shut down in Myanmar right now,  it's very hard for Americans to get news about it. It's far more profitable for American news channels to report on Reddit and Twitter and to get talking heads to yell at each other about it.

What rights do you not have? Universal rights are, be necessity,  broad and general such as ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"". And those rights must no infringe on the rights of others or they are self-invalidating.

I agree, 3 millón (google says 1.5 million) people is probably not a ""tiny tiny minority"", I would say it is a ""tiny minority"" but let's be honest the word tiny has no denotative meaning in this context and so it's childish play to fuss about such things. I find that people who make a fuss about innocent words to not typically be serious people, I hope you are not one of these petty tyrants that thinks ""getting"" someone over a single word with a non specific meaning is a way to ""win"" a discussion, because that would, in that case, make you a bully. Probably the term just bothered you for your own emotional reasons and you didn't think before commenting on it. That's ok, it happens to all of us. Best to avoid being so emotionally fragile though-which again, is what we should all aspire to!

So - only so much can be done to accommodate the needs of 1% of the population. About the same number of Americans are blind, and yet we don't have railings covering every walkable area in the US the get them from place to place. Adult diaper wearers are more than 1% of the population, and yet we still have fabric chairs in businesses and cars. 100% of the country should not be the victim of physical violence, that includes trans people of course. 100% of the population should be free to hold any personal opinion they wish as long as they do not physically agrees on anyone else - that includes trans people, straight people, furries, whomever. 

&#x200B;

AND - finally - we all have our gifts and burdens that are in and out of our control. Being trans would not be easy. Neither would being born with a missing limb. Having an off-the-charts IQ makes life hard. Autism makes life hard. Losing your parents when you are a child makes life hard. The rest of society can try to accommodate, but none of us can expect all of society to bend to our unique challenges.

When Nelson Mandela was in jail he was offered to recall the MK movement as this was the armed wing and it was making the lives of Whites extremely unsafe. Mandela refused and served a few more years till Apartheid regime understood that a man who has given his entire life for his principles was not gonna give in now, no matter the prize. 

Aung Sang Su Ky, too has paid that price. She has spent her entire life behind closed doors. She finally settled for whatever she could gather for her country from the junta, but what she did not do was make a case for her country internationally when they did get that small whatever, which btw would have supported her right now, and she did not condemn what continued to happen in Myanmar, instead she gave the junta a seal of approval. Yes she was under pressure, but she did give a clean chit to a genocide and the whole world turned its head away. That was the power of Su Ky's word. 

However, have you imagined the uproar against the junta if Su Ky would've found the courage somehow and instead had condemned them? 

Miss Su Ky is an inspiration unparallel, but she did not handle very well the power she finally got as a democratically elected premier with the backing of a whole country steadfast behind her. She unfortunately really did not. The whole Myanmar stuck its head in sand and got busy 'rebuilding' as if nothing was wrong. And Junta not only remained an independent bloc, backed by China, it continued to directly control so many regions where people from even within the Myanmar itself could not even go, let alone foreigners. 

To think that the neighbors fire would not catch on your home is foolish. And to think that what junta was doing to rohingyas would not become the norm in the country again was plain denial. 

What happened was a matter of when, not if.

The Rohingya issue the NLD clearly failed as a government on, their reasoning was appeasement of the army to avoid a coup (ironically). The Myanmar military did not go apeshit after one instance of rebellion. They have a policy of collective punishment to any dissent, regardless of if you are part of the minority or the majority.  


Tomato is just parroting the Western Mass Media Consumption Rhetoric of Muslims Vs Buddhists. He tosses in the Karen conflict (its spelled with an E) as a footnote. The truth of the situation is that Myanmar has been in the world's longest multisided civil war. We have had at least 2 communist and mujihadeen insurrections between 1950 and 1980 and that has fed into the military's propaganda and brutality. Also democracy in Myanmar, like the Internet in Myanmar was a recent development.  Most of the country, especially the older generation, is terrified of the army and views speaking out against them to be more or less suicidal.  


Thus when the Rohingya genocide occurred, most Myanmar were not even aware of the scope of the issue. Some of the older generation, the violent racist fringe and the ultra nationalists believed in the military shills (mostly on facebook - which FB itself admitted its failure to curb this). There were people who tried to raise awareness, give donations to the Rohingya and even protest. Some were arrested, some were ""disappeared"", some were disowned by their own charities (like Maung Zarni). Regardless, it is a great disservice to truth to state that all of Myanmar deserve this. You don't judge American by the rantings of people on 8chan or twitter? Why are you judging all of the Burmese people by the actions of a few? Did the 1 year old deserve to be headshot? Did he choose the years of dictatorship?

Actually most of the Burmese and the tribal people are peaceful. All of Myanmar is resource rich. The persecution is happening right now as well as decades.
