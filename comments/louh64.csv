Just a week before the coup take place, the Commander-in-Chief met with the Chinese foreign minister. News circulate that they discussed the issue of ""fraudulent election."" And people noticed. The commander in chief also met with the Russian defense minister and Indian military, but people didn't pay attention as much.

Days after the coup take place, the UN security council to pass a resolution to condemn the coup but Russia and China blocked it. People started to pay attention to China.

A couple of weeks after the coup, the airport was shut down because people protested for not going to work. The military began to shut down telecommunication nationwide in an attempt to stop people from organizing. The people who monitor flight data noticed several cargo planes arriving at the airport from China, words of mouth suggests the planes bought in loads of equipment and Chinese technicians. Leaked photos show wooden boxes of military ammunitions maybe? This news spread on social media, and the authorities explain that the cargos were seafood.

What most people are missing is that 1. Myanmar's commander in chief also met with the Russian defense minister just days before meeting the Chinese foreign minister. 2. Russia also blocked the UN security council from condemning the coup. 3. The wooden boxes in the leaked photo appear to be containing Russian surface-to-air missiles.",5,5,1613956396.0,novazee
