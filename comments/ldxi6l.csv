Her government is relatively new and have no influence whatsoever on the military. Even though she should have spoke up against the atrocities, I also understand that she is in a really tough position with military. The media never reported when they killed her right hand Muslim man to threaten her to push her up against the world stage. If she went against the military actions, what do you think would've happened to her. Either detained/killed like him. She sacrificed more than half of her life for the people and the country instead of spending time with her kids and grandchilds in UK. Everyone is quick to point fingers at her. How about try to step into her shoe for once. What would you have done.",11,1,1612654941.0,None
t1_gmanivr,gmaw474,"If she went against the military, what is happening currently in Myanmar would have come sooner. The military was stirring and controlling everything around her. Although her government is named to have authority, the military was still pulling the strings behind with their people and the previous government term before NLD set laws that are unfavorable to current NLD government. Now NLD won the election by landslide and military is trying to put everything back in their power. All minorities are now in danger and we cannot predict what future holds in their palms but for sure, I can tell that there won’t be as much freedom and development like past 5 years.

There are many unaddressed problems due to their abusive power. Myanmar’s politics is very complicated. Citizens are put in a trap set by their tricky laws and rules that they had planned for decades so that the country is under their power no matter how people attempt to win the government legally. Even if NLD did like back in 2015 and this recent election, nothing changes. That’s why now is the time for everybody to step up or else no future for Myanmar at all!!",1,2,1612666497.0,missingwin

t1_gmbnvpo,gmcku2r,"Pls note that armchair social media warriors care little for on the  ground realities. After all it is all about staying woke without substance. The Wokesters pound here on Genocide yet when their home countries shut off the Rohingyas (Australia to Malaysia and Indonesia) or made them wait for years for any permanent resettlement or a solution despite UN recognizing the issue as far back in the 50s all your hear is crickets.

The same wokesters also did  the same with Timor (Genocide), Sri Lanka (War crimes), the Romas  (Stateless/Persecuted) , the Kurds, the ME refugees fleeing homelands after so called regime change  misadventures of the West, the Child Soldiers of the Lords resistance army  (LRA) etc. The last one was a real cracker if anyone remember Kony 2012. Huge social media hoopla claiming to bring Joseph Kony the leader of the LRA to justice by the end of 2012. Despite ICC charges only Kony's lieutenants have surrendered and faced charges. Add to the comedy in 2017 US and Uganda ended the hunt for Kony believing that the LRA was no longer a significant security risk to Uganda!. Yep no more talk of justice. And in 2017 did we hear anything from the Wokesters. Nope.

BUT while sharing, tweeting, liking etc they collected  $5 million in the first two days of the campaign and netted even more from celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, who gave a cool $2 million. Bill Gates tweeted the hashtag; Rihanna shared the video. That is how social media dopamine hit s work.

If those who are horrified by the Genocide really do care for the victims and people like myself who have survived civil war and the horrors of it and then worked on the ground do us a bloody favor:

1. Get the United States to ratify the the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and become a state party.
2. Pressure your local governments to faithfully execute the UN principle of the responsibility to protect (R2P) which was formulated after the 1990 Rwandan Genocide, for timely intervention to protect populations at risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.
3. Adopt universal jurisdiction through legislation with regards to war crimes, crimes against humanity, torture or genocide enabling the prosecution of war criminals, ethnic cleansers and other monsters no matter where the said crime took place.

By doing the above we send a message to would be perpetrators that you have no place to hide and no matter what the world repudiates such crimes again populations. In doing so we ensure human security of the vulnerable people while FINALLY making ""Never again"" a reality!",1,2,1612676318.0,godofones

The military wanted the Rohingya dead, and there was absolutely nothing the civilian government could do to stop them.
