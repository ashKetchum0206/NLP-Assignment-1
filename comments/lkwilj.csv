t1_gnmy74q,gnmzhbu," It seems to be a new trend to blame Russia and China in every conflict. 

Well, MAH staged a coup a few days after he met with the foreign minister of CCP, Wang Yi. Is it not a huge coincidence? Before that, there's a Rohingya refugee crisis that the military is to blame. 
So, there's a huge pressure on MAH and the military. Wang Yi basically persuaded MAH to stage a coup by saying something like ""Hey,I'm not sure about whether we can protect from having to go to ICJ if DASSK is in charge. But we can, if you're in charge."" On top of that, UN security council had an emergency meeting discussing about the military coup in Myanmar, you know what CCP and Russia said, "" It's just a change of parliament."" and refused to condemn the coup. 
MAH is fucking coward and he would never stage a coup like this without someone powerful backing him. And that powerful MFs are none other than Russia and CCP.",2,1,1613476782.0,Edison_K-69420

Russia and China refuses to condemn the coup. 

That means Russia and China are supporting, covertly if not openly, the coup in Myanmar.
Moreover, some soldiers, quite possibly Chinese, arrived in Yangon yesterday, in response to the anti-coup protests. The air traffic control in YGN International Airport has been shut down, but yesterday there are some flights from Kuming has arrived. Isn't that a huge coincidence? 
For Putin, he'll lose a buyer for his weapons if Myanmar becomes more democratic.

t1_gnn0qbe,gnn203x,":) I'm not against myanmar protestors, belive me. You've better stop put Russia and Putin in every gap. Some of us are leaving in Russian Federation, respect Putins policy in some ways. We can argue allday long, don't be toxic. Almost every supreme countries got blood on their hands, even US. Use google translate: Конфликт власти в Мьянме, сугубо внутреннее дело этой страны, но это не дает повод винить во всем Россию. Путинский режим продает оружие военным Мьянмы, плохо конечно, но это бизнес, ничего личного. Мне, как человеку, который чуточку ознакомился с историей Мьянмы, конечно жаль людей. Столько было военных режимов, гонений на честных граждан, которые добивались элементарных прав на свободу и тд. Я лишь пытаюсь объяснить, что Путинский режим и Россия - это две абсолютно разные вещи. Если собираетесь винить Россию, то лучше винить режим, а не целую страну. Будь умнее, не будь токсичным. Среди нас есть люди, которые поддерживают политику В.В.Путина, даже если вас это дико раздражает.",-1,4,1613478736.0,danik23

t1_gnn203x,gnn42mj,"Firstly, I don't know a single word of Russian.
Secondly, your government always say ""Myanmar is one step closer to become an ally."" Is this how you guys treat your allies? By fucking stabbing in the back? CCP is the same,either. They just support the coup so they can get hold of some fucking resources in the country. 
While you MFs are blaming the US for spilling the blood in Iraq and Afghanistan, you done the same kind of shit in Ukraine and Georgia. 
America doesn't help us, but they're not the one who stabbed us in the back either. I'd rather starve under a democracy than living a good life under the dictatorship. 
Also, why the fuck should I respect Putin's policy if I live 2800 miles from Moscow? 
Shame on Putin and shame on Xi Jingping and shame on each and everyone of you who refuses to condemn the coup.

Secondly, every goddamn leader in every goddamn supreme country selling weapons to the other countries or this is big surprise for you? I didn't find any evidence that we are, russian, supporting myanmar military coup by selling weapons, aircraft for only one purpose; to eleminate every protestor. By the way, you are MF here, I'm not blaming US. Finally, I didn't asked you to respect Putins policy, in some cases people in Russia respect his authority and policy.

P.S. And I'm also not against myanmar protests, I hope democracy wins. So stop spitting and blaming every russian, don't be toxic.",1,6,1613531246.0,danik23
