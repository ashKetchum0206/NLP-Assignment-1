It is a meme, that call people don’t be a bad Burmese soldier and be a regime’s dog. And stress the badness of Myanmar soldiers nowadays. What’s wrong with you.?",1,5,1623659205.0,a43991314520
t1_h1n6lj0,h1n73uf,why are we pretending memes accomplish anything instead of doing something that'll actually bring change?,1,6,1623607017.0,Moist-Buy147
t1_h1plb5v,h1qlilz,I find it ironic you call my sentences strange when it's obvious your english is lacking but hey 🤷‍♂️ what do I know? I guess making memes is more important,1,6,1623683724.0,Moist-Buy147
t1_h1n73uf,h1n7sdf,"Memes accomplish one thing for certain; it brings fun. If you want something that'll either cause damage to the junta or facilitate war efforts, you may as well donate to EAOs or refugee camps.",4,7,1623607353.0,xvigg
t1_h1qlilz,h1qmqce,"If you have any misunderstanding, I say that, dogs under regime means government’s soldiers and whom are supporting military government.

Again, I question your opinion. Are you blaming a meme and stress that the meme is effortless? Why do you get so many unvotes? Haven’t you ever thought of your comments?",1,7,1623684284.0,a43991314520
t1_h1n7sdf,h1n82m3,I don't see any fun in useless memes when it seems there's more important things that could be done to oppose military. Maybe that's just me 🤷‍♂️,1,8,1623607495.0,Moist-Buy147
t1_h1qmqce,h1qn6vn,"let me make it simple since it's patently clear english is not your native tongue. 

Im not questioning WHO ""dogs of regime"" is referring to. It's pretty obvious who that is. Im asking you how making memes inflict any damage to them. How is this effective for a ""revolution""",2,8,1623684497.0,Moist-Buy147
t1_h1n82m3,h1n897z,"Dude, this is Reddit",4,9,1623607582.0,xvigg
t1_h1qn6vn,h1rohmj,"No Burmese come out and say that it is not good for making a meme! Do you follow some local Burmese pages? They do not only share news and they make memes also.

I suppose you are not Burmese and you only make strifes. I think the revolution is hindered by you but not a meme. 
You can have a stance that yea everybody should not make memes as it is not effective for revolution. No... it should not come like that.",0,9,1623701207.0,a43991314520
t1_h1qn6vn,h1rlonu,"Yea, I am not a native speaker. Don’t care about my grammar or my organisation of sentences. I don’t know where are you from and plz don’t care about my nationality. Back to the topic, it is ironic as you blame the meme and say it is effortless for the revolution. And haven’t you thought yourself, so do you nasty comment help the local revolution instead of a meme? Your behaviour is worse than a meme. 
In my opinion, making any memes or sharing news of Burmese can be a way to spread the voice of supporting Burmese people. Do you know how does propaganda work? Even a little meme, can be a way for supporting them. Or do you leave your comment under every memes but not news? 
If we don’t donate money, the best way of supporting them is keeping up with the news and spread the voice of them, and yours also. Not making strifes. ‘Do not split’ have you ever heard it? I wonder if you have any creative ideas which give direct assistance to the revolution.",1,9,1623699941.0,a43991314520
t1_h1qn6vn,h1rmgsk,"Have you seen any propaganda during WWII, Cold War and CCP’s regime from history book? If a poster can be propaganda, why can’t a meme be a force to support revolution? It contains stance and that’s the point.",1,9,1623700299.0,a43991314520
t1_h1n897z,h1n8ijq,so why are you on reddit instead of finding ways to hurt the military? youre able to have fun online. doesnt seem like such a bad coup to me,1,1,1623607709.0,Moist-Buy147
t1_h1rlonu,h1sf83a,"no, youre obviously not a native speaker. Your grammar and the fact you somehow think I was asking who the dogs were exposes a fundamental lack of understandinf",1,1,1623713526.0,Moist-Buy147

t1_h1rq1qg,h1rrn9n,"So if the worldwide supports Burmese people, we should not make propaganda and memes anymore? No, propaganda is an additional way to support them. I said, if you can’t provide money or military support, then the soft method is a way. Keeping up with news and having a heart to support them. That’s it. I am so tired of having meaningless communication with you.",1,2,1623702657.0,a43991314520
t1_h1rq1qg,h1rs7hn,"Dumbass, if you claim that soft power cannot stop military government, then you are worse than the soft power. Getting 0 and getting -1. Lmao, just shut up. You cannot provide money and bullet, but bullshit.",1,2,1623702917.0,a43991314520

Fact of the matter is people need hope and fun during these times, they need to release stress anxiety hatred. Who are you to gate keep someone who’s not even harming nobody? this is Reddit for God’s sake, people have the right to post what they want. Really…the OP has every right to be mad at Tatmadaw for the shit they’ve done.
