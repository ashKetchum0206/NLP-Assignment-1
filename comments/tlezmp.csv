t3_tlezmp,i1uktke,Yemen has been drowned so thoroughly that it doesn’t even get a shoutout,22,0,1648070513.0,flyinggazelletg
t3_tlezmp,i1x9z1o,"I love Myanmar, visited, and donated before (and same with Hong Kong as I used to work there) and hope it gets the attention it deserves. But what I don’t see in posts like these is an understanding in the difference between a foreign country invading and an internal civil war/coup, even if the coup has outside influence or support. Many countries see that difference and take very different responses between the two, however bad the situation is. If Taiwan is invaded by china it should get the same support Ukraine is but it’s sad that it probably won’t because too many countries don’t recognize it. It’s also sad that the level of support is related to the resources desired from the country (oil, gas, Ukraine has huge amounts, minerals, technology (TSMC)). It doesn’t help that Myanmar was cut off from the world for so many decades before. Continue to leverage the attention people are giving Ukraine into attention for Myanmar, etc just also understand some of the differences that are the basis of the different level of response.",16,0,1648126083.0,buzzwrong
