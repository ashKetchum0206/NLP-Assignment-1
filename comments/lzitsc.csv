I am profoundly saddened by the authoritarianism in Myanmar, Thailand, HK.
But the USA will not be intervening militarily in another conflict in SE Asia. Just not going to happen.

There will be regional pressure from China at some point to end the coup. Not because they are concerned about innocent people being beaten, but because 54 million people aren't buying their goods on a daily basis.

t1_gq2s4lf,gq2wo3z,"Edit 1: u/fatguyinalittlecar12 and u/Spear_Pikachu have indicated that the case in fact came from a **5.56 × 45mm NATO** cartridge, and not from a 7.62 × 51mm NATO cartridge like I sad.

Edit 2: when I first posted this comment, I had only seen weapons chambered for the 7.62 × 51mm NATO and 9 × 19mm parabellum rounds. Starting today (08-03-2021) I have started seeing the newer Galil clones chambered for the 5.56 × 45mm NATO cartridge.

I'm not certain about the actual designations, but they're all clones or licensed productions of other guns.

The following are the weapons I've seen them use since February 1st. I've left out pistols, shotguns, and grenade launchers. 

Assault rifle - [Heckler & Koch G3 variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_G3)
DMR/Sniper rifle - [Zastava M91 variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zastava_M91)
DMR/Sniper rifle - [Zastava M76 variant](https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Zastava_M76)
SMG/Machine Pistol - [Uzi variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzi)

Both the assault rifle and the DMRs use 7.62 × 51mm NATO rounds, and the machine pistol uses 9 × 19mm Parabellum rounds. For both types of rounds, I've only seen them use full metal jacket bullets.

~~Judging by the cartridge case, it appears to be from a 7.62 × 51mm NATO cartridge. So I would say it either came from the G3-variant assault rifle, or one of the DMR's.~~ The case is from a 5.56 × 45mm NATO cartridge. See edit on the top of my comment.

I've also seen pictures of .22 long rifle rounds in circulation; however to my knowledge, the military does not have a weapon chambered for this round.

5.56 rounds are used by the military and they have been issuing newer assault rifles chambered for this round for a few years now. However, I have seen no such weapon being issued to any of the ""riot control"" units. The mitary's mouthpiece news stations did show a bullet from a 5.56 × 45 mm NATO cartridge and stated that it was the standard ammunition used by the police force, in a report last night on their ""investigation"" into the death of ကြယ်စင်, a 19-year-old girl who was shot in the back of the head and killed by the military and police. Although they said the 5.56 was the standard round used in the police weapons, as I've stated above, I have not seen anything being used that is issued by the military that is chambered for the round.",18,3,1615105536.0,chileConChile
t1_gq2s4lf,gq31p04,"presuming that the myanmar police now has access to the navy firearms, and thanks to wikipedia, i can determine some of the firearms that are possibly used by the police.  


how i counted out these guns.  
1) they are in service in the myanmar navy  
2) they are chambered in 5.56x45 NATO  


here is the list:  
\- MA-3 family of smgs and carbines (MK-I, MK-II and MK-III, which is a bullpup.) all are made in myanmar, reminicent of the MA-1 family, which is fucking weird because there isn't a real difference between the ma-3 and ma-1 families...  
\- MA-1 family of ARs, (MK-I, MK-II, MK-III which is, again, a bullpup)  
mk-i is a licensed galil copy. mk-ii is an mk-i but with more original furniture and improved design.  
mk-iii is a licensed copy of the CHINESE BULLPUP QBZ-95/97.

\- MA-4 family is the MA-1 but with underbarrel M203 40x46mm grenade launchers.   
all i can say about them is that they are most likely used to launch tear gas grenades, and i just hope they wont actually use real armed grenades. if you realize the grenades are real, stay away from big groups and try to find cover, as shrapnel flies at such a high velocity, it can SHRED through the human body. god save you all if this ever happens.

\- the MA-11 is the most original one, being the HK33 AR. You'll have some trouble diffrentiating it from the BA-63, the G3 licensed copy, but you can EASILY differ them just by looking at the magazine. 7.62x51 magazines are STRAIGHT and the 5.56 ones are ROUNDED.

\- they use a bunch of norinco guns, however, i'm 99.99% sure you will never see a 5.8x42mm casing, as myanmar seems to more use the 5.56 nato one. however, you will see the QBZ-03, QBZ-97 and the Norinco CQ, which looks like an M16A2.

I AM NOT SURE... if they are using LMGs for the police. 

\- the MA-12 is probably an MA-11 but with a homemade drum magazine and a heavy barrel (most likely longer too)

\- MA-2 family of guns is the same as the MA-1 family, but with longer barrels and most likely extended magazines.  
the MA-2 MK-III is probably a QBB-95 - a drum mag QBZ-95 witha  bipod and longer barrel.  


if you want to DISARM a police officer with live rounds, and you have to either hit the gun out of their hands or somehow try to hit the mag release usually behind the magazine. all of the guns in service of the myanmar navy are ""ak-style"" push release behind-the-magazine type of mag releases, so if you google absolutely any of the guns used by the navy, you'll easily find the magazine release tucked in riiiight behind the magazine itself, you push that forward to the side of the magazine.

i hope this helps, godspeed.

t1_gq2s4lf,gq31csc,"Does it really matter the type of gun? Most rifles chambering for the cartridge will have similar performances. Really technical people will argue a bit but at the range Burmese protestors are being shot at in cities and towns, it doesn't really make a difference.

Still, seen most often in videos and photos of Myanmar soldiers are the MA-4 domestically made licence copies of the Israeli IMI Galil assault rifles. And they fire 5.56. Other rifles include the MA-11, another domestic copy of the German HK-33. Direct imports include Norinco CQ, which is an unlicensed copy of the M16. There are also a couple of QBZs.

Again, does it matter, though? Don't blame China, BTW. The most common I see on photos are copies of the Israeli Galil.",4,3,1615110233.0,None

t1_gq2wo3z,gq5gazo,">Judging by the cartridge case, it appears to be from a 7.62 × 51mm NATO cartridge.

That's not a 7.62 x 51. The 7.62 shell casing has a slightly longer neck. This shell casing had a shorter neck.

A 7.62 x51 hitting the head at close range will not result in the kind of injury that have been seen on photos. the 7,62 x 51 projectile hits the body with such a force that the skin literally detaches from the skull and the skull is often spit in half. Imagine someone skinning the victim's face off their skull and leave the skin hanging; yes, that's the kind of terminal ballistic of a 7.62 x 51 projectile.",2,4,1615158283.0,None

They absolutely can, historically, they were used to [hunt animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gun).

>Throughout 17th to 19th century, air guns in .30 to .51 calibers were used to hunt big-game deer and wild boar. These air rifles were charged using a pump to fill an air reservoir and gave velocities from 650 to 1,000 ft/s (200 to 300 m/s).

These will make them equivalent to a subsonic large bore pistol cartridge, which absolutely can go through skulls.

There were also used in wars, with the most notable one being the [Girardoni air rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girardoni_air_rifle) which was used by the the Austrian army from 1780 to around 1815.

[Modern air rifles](https://www.fieldandstream.com/story/guns/big-bore-airguns-powerful-enough-to-take-big-game/) can be used to hunt deer- and hog-sized animals. Can they kill humans? absolutely.",1,1,1615199523.0,None
