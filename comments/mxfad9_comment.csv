The Tatmadaw Govt irregardless if they are the legitimate or illegitimate Govt of Myanmar, they are the ones in power right now. They are the ones with the guns, bullets and tanks. They are the ones doing the killing. 

ASEAN's priority is to get MAH to agree to go to the negotiation table and negotiate with NUG/NLD for a compromise. 

If ASEAN invites the NUG, it might jeopardise the meeting and its intended outcome. Hence they were not invited. 

It is reported that MAH has agreed to go to the negotiation table, MAH should order a ceasefire and release ASSK and the protesters.

ASEAN will then speak to NUG/NLD to get them to the negotiation table.

t1_gvpmhj4,gvqpent,"Your reply is logical from the perspective of an outsider. But we as insiders know about the atrocities committed by these criminals since 1960. Let's assume you are from a first world country like Singapore judging by your level of English and to have a relative comparison.  

Your government protects you well, provides a platform for equal opportunity for all citizens and creates tremendous amount of scholarship funded opportunities to groom local talents even if they wish to go overseas for studies.  The only catch is that, you need to finish your 2 year National service. Now if you put yourself in our shoes, we receive nothing. No funded scholarships, no equal treatment, tons and tons of red tapes, no proper pensions, no acceptable quality of healthcare and the list goes on and on. The resources that are generated go deep into the junta's pocket and they send their offsprings overseas to 1st world countries in Europe and Australia. They might not even want to send their children to Singapore even though it is well classified as a first world country. But to them, they want the cream of the crops in terms of luxury. Our citizens are left starting literally from scratch for every single thing. If you are born in a decent middle class family, you are slightly better than the rest in terms of securing a good future. 

Apart from that, look at what these murderers have done to Rohingyas, Shan, Kayins, Kachins and other minorities.  They put a blanket on media and mount machine guns on helicopters to shoot into tiny little houses in rural areas and try to kill as much as possible.  There has never been equal treatment nor opportunities for the minorities.  The army recruits child soldiers forcefully and brainwashes them since a young age by sprinkling religion to justify their atrocities.  If you look at the picture as an insider, we have been getting the short end of the stick for the past 7 decades.  That's the reason why we do not ever want this dictator to come and destroy our generation. We only have ourselves defending each other right now.",1,4,1619292941.0,oo82

ASEAN'S intention is to get the Tatmadaw to refrain from using lethal force, release ASSK and other political prisoners and go to the negotiation table with NLD/NUG. ASEAN can only act a peace broker.

This is the 5 points plan that ASEAN had proposed.

It does not mean that the Burmese people have to accept or agreed with it. The choice is with the NUG and the people to decide what is best for Myanmar and for themselves. If your people are adamant that the Tatmadaw are to be ousted completely, there will be no need for negotiation or compromise.

t1_gvqpent,gvrtmru,"You are spot on that I am from Singapore and your comment from the point of view as a Burmese is logical as well. 

What you mentioned about it, it is not that rosy as you think it is in Singapore, that's a discussion for another time.

I do know what the Tatmadaw had been doing for decades.

What would you had done if you are an ASEAN leader?

I do know the claims of fraudulent election result are likely to be false since no evidence of it had ever been produced and the charges against ASSK are all made up so that she cannot legally participate in any future elections.

Let's go back to the current situation, if the road plans of ASEAN is not workable and the Burmese people are adamant that the Tatmadaw to be totally out of politics and even dismantle, the Tatmadaw will not accept it and the violent crackdowns will continue resulting in more deaths.

This will eventually become a civil war. Deaths will be thousands or hundreds of thousands, there will be a large group of refugees, there will be shortage of food, water, medical supplies and sanitation which will lead to outbreak of diseases. Cities, villages, infrastructures and the economy will be destroyed. 

When the war ends, tons of money is needed to rebuild all the above. 

Let's discuss about the Federal Army, if it is eventually form, their combined military assets do not have military capability and hardwares like what the Tatmadaw has like tanks, APC, mobile missile launchers, artillery, Fighter jets, attack helicopters, etc.

The rebels groups had fought against the Tatmadaw for decades but all these are mostly skirmishes in their own held up areas. A full civil war will have military confrontations across different terrains in which the rebels group might not be familiar like in cities. Strategy will also be different. 

Without proper military equipments and strategy, and depending on skirmishes to wipe out the Tatmadaw will take decades.

There are Burmese who hopes/expects a foreign nation intervention by deployment of troops into Myanmar to fight your military. This is very unlikely to happen for many reasons.

The higher the hopes/expectations, the bigger the disappointment if your hopes/expectations is not fulfilled.

1. China will not want US or her Allies troops so near her border. Think about the Korean War.
2. The risk of a diplomatic row with China or Russia or both which could lead to a military confrontation and eventually WW3 in a nuclear era.
3. The World nations Govt's priority is with their own citizens especially in this worldwide pandemic and not with the citizens of a foreign sovereign country.
4. US will not want another unpopular war especially in South East Asia after the Vietnam war. 
5. There is more to lose than to gain by getting physically involved in Myanmar.
6. UN peacekeeping troops cannot without the approval of all council members in UNSC. 
7. UN peacekeeping troops are not for military operations even if they are deployed.

I do understand the frustrations and even desperation of the Burmese people. What the Burmese eventually decides to do, it is their choice but they have to bear the responsibilities, consequences and repercussions of their choices and actions.
