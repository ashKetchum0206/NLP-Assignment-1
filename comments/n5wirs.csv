Yes, you’ve explained very well that China is an extremely selfish nation. That’s why they don’t care if they use Muslims as slave labor and out them in concentration camps.

Saudi Arabia only because Iran is worse. At least historically but under the new leader, things may have to be rethought. That’s the difference between most of the western powers and China. The west often chooses the lesser of two Evils. China doesn’t care and often sides with the more evil

Please tell me how Iran, a country with democratic elections, is worse than Saudi Arabia, which regularly beheads people for minor offenses?

Biden pulled out any support for Saudi Arabia. Trump is bad. But see, here’s the difference — chinas been giving the Myanmar military weapons for years so Myanmar military can commit genocide and keep power over the people of Myanmar. Biden pulled support from Saudi Arabia and is rethinking its alliance with Saudi Arabia. 

> Please tell me how Iran, a country with democratic elections

Is it true democracy if the religious leaders pick the candidates?! Iran is the one supplying the Houthis with weapons— the same Houthis who started the war. Iran has troops in Syria defending the chemical weapon using genocidal maniac Assad. Iran also funds terrorism through the Middle East such as hezbollah. Iran has frequently threatened to nuke or bomb Israel. 

> Was Bolivia's democratically elected Morales more evil than the far-right government

No relevance to anything here. Morales wanted to become a dictator and had the police be brutal on protestors. He was kicked out and police then beat up the new protesters. New elections were held and far right government isn’t in power.

But of course you want to defend Evo since he tried to become dictator Putin style. He ignored referendums and had his stacked courts Eliminate term limits so he can rule forever.

But that “coup” was internal. The military leader didn’t want Bolivia turning into another dictatorship",1,2,1620358587.0,None

The business continues as usual. Promising to cancel one arms sales deal doesn't mean Washington isn't supportive of the government.

>chinas been giving the Myanmar military weapons for years

The west has been selling and giving weapons to Saudi Arabia and even the Taliban for years, and your justification for that is?

>Morales wanted to become a dictator and had the police be brutal on protestors. 

Gosh, you are so delusional. Morales was democratically elected, and it was overthrown by a western-backed right-wing coup that literally shot at Boliavian's indigenous people.

I already said Iran. Iran...the same country funding reprise throughout the middleast, funding/supplying  the Houthis who started the Yemen war, finding militias in Syria to defend Assad, hezbellah, etc

Now you’re being stupid. That was 35 years ago. Before they became terrorist and it was to fight off the invading Soviets. 
 

> Gosh, you are so delusional. Morales was democratically elected

Are you saying he did not ignore his first term as counting towards the term limits? Are you saying he did not ignore the will of the people when a referendum was passed to keep 2 term limit? Are you saying he did not have his Supreme Court stacked with his judges overturn the referendum to eliminate term limits?

True democracies don’t have unlimited terms for presidents but since you’re in China, you think what Xi does is normal

You’re sources on Bolivia didn’t show that the US ordered the coup. And you’re ignoring they held elections again and the right wing party lost. They were true to their words — elections were held


I know you defend Evo Morales because he supported China on its concentration camps of Muslims

As I said, they didn't ""pull the support"", they simply pulled arms sales due to tremendous pressure, but the statement I linked told you clearly that cooperation WILL continue. It's very pathetic of you to attempt to whitewash it.

I'd prefer a Muslim country with some level of democracy and freedom over a country that literally enforces Sharia Law. Isn't it funny that you condemn the military dictatorship of Myanmar, yet you defend one of the most dictatorial regimes in the world? lol. Bootlicker.

>Are you saying he did not ignore his first term as counting towards the term limits?

Bolivian people made their choice, and it's not the American government's right to interfere with Bolivia's domestic affair.

If the coup against Morales was justified, why did the right-wing government massacre the people who opposed the coup? You defend military governments and massacres whenever it suits YOUR political orientation. Shameful.
