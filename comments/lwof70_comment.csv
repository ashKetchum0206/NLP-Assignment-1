t1_gpko21w,gpmbw53,"Our ""government"" before this was a quasi-democracy. Although we were on paper ""democratic"", our constitution (written by the military that oppressed us and killed ethnic minorities for decades) always allowed 25% (regardless of votes) of the seats in parliament to the military. Thus, we had a civillian branch (75%) and military branch (25%).

Additionally, the military had it's own political party called USDP which people (extremists right wing supports like Wirathu, basically the Hitler for Rohingyas) could vote for. So this means that the Military (military branch and USDP) had a lot of control when it came to our decisions. They control immigrants and defenses and more, as they were the ones who massacred the Rohingyas. We're fighting now for democracy, meaning to eliminate the 25% (and more) share that the military dogs hold in our country. 

Our government now is the CRPH who are the rightful democratically elected leaders in hiding. They are basically working to represent Myanmar in the UN and so on.

t1_gpm1dtd,gpmuypb,"This is a reply I got from another comment I made:

I'm a Burmese currently living in Yangon.

1. Yes. I very much want the USA to get involved. It doesn't even have to be armed forces. Drone or missile strikes would be enough. And this is what nearly everyone in my country wants right now. A lot of people are so desperate for US help to the point they want to give away some land to the US or they would happily become a US colony.
2. I personally don't feel that way. But everyday, we feel helpless for all the dead people that we couldn't save. How can we, an unarmed population, win a fight against an armed and trained military? For most of us, foreign intervention is our biggest dream now.

Most people here see the US as world police, in a good way, and that's what I see too. If the US never took part in the Korean war, there wouldn't be South Korea of today. What I always tell to those who don't like the idea of the US being world police is this - imagine China or Russia being world police. The only reason the entire world (except america of course) hasn't been annexed by China and Russia is because they fear the US. Otherwise, the organ harvesting done by CCP would be done everywhere.

They have routinely shown to exploit that position for their own profits. 

They have installed puppet dictators to get cheap oil. They have assassinated innocent left-wing activists because they threaten American profits. They’ve couped entire democratically-elected governments just to squash any talk of nationalising precious resources. 

Why do you think America would stop this, when this happens in America without repercussion? If they- you- cannot even reign in your own police force, what gives you the audacity to think you’d reign in your troops? Because you didn’t in the middle east, you didn’t in latin america... instead, your country made a whole law that if **anyone** held American soldiers to account for war crimes, they would **invade that country**. 

The moral obligation you speak of isn’t to ramp up your evidently morally corrupt military. There’s an argument for helping monetarily, but even then, America can’t be trusted to not include predatory payback terms in that help- “we’ll help you out, if you let us do x y and z”. 

The moral obligation is to realise you’re not better than these people and that you need to fix your own broken system that defines “any male over 16” as a terrorist so long as they’re in a country that the US is bombing or invading. The moral obligation is to stop American companies profiting off of war & tragedy. The moral obligation is to ensure that if you were to help, you wouldn’t just be replacing one evil coup with another.

t1_gpqtjhm,gpr6lua,"Yeah if it goes back to 1962, I think its over for the people of Myanmar.  It will be a long time before Myanmar can even catch up to the rest of Southeast Asia as if I'm not mistaken Myanmar is the poorest country in Southeast Asia?  Even poorer than Cambodia and Laos?

I had this talk with my dad after asking you this question.  My dad say the Myanmar military is not as bad as the VCP because the VCP follow a communist doctrine while the Junta have no such doctrine.  He also said that the soldiers are loyal to the VCP while the Myanmar soldiers are not brainwash as only the top leader of the military are corrupt and cruel.  He said there are bad soldiers but not all soldiers are bad.  We both agree that if Myanmar fall again, people of Myanmar will be worst than the Vietnamese.  He explain that it will feel much worst due to anger as Myanmar got to experience a quasi-democrat government.

He say the main differences between the Junta and VCP is Myanmar was colonized by the British which gave them autonomy and independent when they left while Vietnam was colonized by the French which destablized Vietnam after they left.  This is why communism will never happen in Myanmar despite the fact that it does seem to have CCP backing.

One thing I would like to ask you is why do you think that Myanmar will go back to 1962 instead of Vietnam currently?  The reason I ask is that while Vietnam GDP grow every year, the VCP literally steal 95% of the country wealth.  In 2014 alone, the U.S had to froze bank account because the VCP stole 146 billions from the Vietnamese people.  146 billions X 46 years (different GDP but you get the point) and that why Vietnam is still a poor country.

Yes. Soldiers are trained to kill. Having mercy to enemies is being unmerciful to ourselves as well as the men next to you. In fact, headshot is golden. And we are taught to squeeze twice in CQB and FIBUA.

But these assholes are not dealing with armed enemies who are going to kill them (thou i believe at this point many alreay mentally killing these assholes). They are killing unarmed, non life threatening civilians! 

I dont mean to tell people to relax, the army is just aiming to injure. All the protestants knows these army are capable to be heartlessly aiming to kill in the head in one shot like game.

But i am coming from a perspective of a myanmar soldier with an ounce of conscience... that perhaps even under orders, could target anywhere but the head. Maybe some of them exist, hence some stray rounds..... BUT let me be crystal clear here just in case....

#to our heroes here... know that the military is capably to kill. Please be smart, stay safe. Run if you must, take cover. And live to see a truly democratic myanmar in the near future.

They know the risk. They know someone may be killed. Yet they stand up as one without violence. They are heroes.

We both strongly agree that this would never happen with the VCP or the CCP or any communist regime, they would laugh so hard at you and then execute you in some far away prison in some rural place.

The ethnic groups had it wayy worse than people in mainland. I have not heard getting killed for no reasons in mainland we were safe as long as we keep our heads down.  


I think the majority of their evil comes from economy!? After Ne Win took power, everyone had their possessions robbed by military(Cars, Businesses, etc) by various ranks from military(Majors, Captains etcs) leaving civilians dirt poor. Plus he denounced some of the currency that were in use because of some superstition, that hit the economy really hard too.  


Top brass controls almost every big corps here, some of them are billionaires(USD).One of the things I have experienced is the mobile phone scam. Myanmar Post and Telecommunication sold their first SIM cards around 5000usd per card around early 2000s and stayed over 1000usd for a long time. They even sold their last sim cards months before foreign telco companies come in with price of around 200$ as a last attempt. SIM cards are worth 1$ here now.  


If you do try to oppose the military its almost  guaranteed you are going to get jailed or tortured or killed. Everyone lived in fear, they do not dare to even have pictures of Aung San Suu Kyi or NLD Flag in their homes and hides them if they do.  


Unfortunately, I know about Vietnam only from a documentary. From what I could tell, the situation is really different as in there were a lot of people supporting north side. We do not have sides here, its always been people vs Military.
