t1_gsdol6h,gsdps2n,"I commented on a post that a Chinese person made here around five or so days ago. There, I expressed how I don't think China's behind the coup.

So this move to go to Russia definitely is a desperate move in my opinion. Min Aung Hlaing tried to get the US to get on their side by saying they are anti-Chinese and that definitely didn't work.

Its hard to beat the military junta, since they have all the modern weapons, but, all the bravery the burmeses have done these months is sending the message to the world. Its shame on Vietnam when our government are reluctant to show disagreement on violating acts happened in Myanmar, just said that they seriously concerned- diplomatic speeches which have no value and strength.
