t3_m6phyq,gr73n6m,"You’re a genius! Fucking brilliant idea! It will at least confuse the shit out of the lower ranks. One question? How do we notify the civilians that there is deep fake video circulating before hand? 

All good making one saying the army is standing down and then for civilians to start celebrating in the street but then getting shot at by the fucking army again??",26,0,1615948954.0,jwfc101

t3_m6phyq,gra47ij,"Hey Everyone!

I know how to deep fake, but I don't know what needs to be done. I am more willing to use my knowledge and resources to make a video, I would just need guidance and some sort of voice-over I assume. I've already gotten the face Min Aung Hlaing, but I have nothing to train them on. Tell me what needs to be done!

t3_m6phyq,gr8bgoo,"This is brilliant but I think it will cause more confusion/false hope among average civilians than the targeted military dogs. The confusion can be cleared in one order in military ranks but normal civilians will keep sharing that over and over, pushing away the real important news on the timeline. 

IMO, it will not bring real impact aside some fun/false hope thing for the civilians",4,0,1615984755.0,LordSynister

t3_m6phyq,gr90zos,"Possible use case of DEEP FAKING to encounter JUNTA propaganda.  

Junta mouthpiece MRTV showed that this ""businessman"" says THE LADY is guilty of corruption. You can see his eyes that he is reading from a script.  

A DEEP FAKE video can be produced stating the opposite of what JUNTA propaganda said.

t1_gr71qla,gr832ve,"Mooching off the top comment. I think families and neighbors of those working for police and military should be collected in a database with pictures like a terrorist record book. 

So those working for police and military should be brought to justice for orchestrating the coup and crimes against civilians. They shouldn't be allowed to hide behind 'orders'  . These people should be treated like terrorists.",5,1,1615978411.0,BigBulkemails

If you don't have a good graphics card this process can take a VERY long time (days to weeks -- even with a good one it can take a while depending on the length and quality). The process is relatively easy to learn in a short amount of time.

If you need a leader saying something you would still need an audio file of the leader saying what you want him to say with someone moving their mouth to say it: I.e you would need a video someone who can give a good impression of the person you're deep-faking.

I am more than willing to answer any questions people may have, or to help in the process of deep-faking.",3,2,1616032240.0,FijiWaterAid
