t3_mkliki,gtj6891,The rule in America is you can do whatever you want until the government says you can’t; that’s how American laws work. And that’s why we (for the most part) “are free.” If you want to do it - then do it ... you don’t need the governments permission. You only can not do it when they say it’s been made illegal. .... that’s the fundamental aspect of having a constitution and a free society..... so yeah .. I call BS on Elon Musk .... I hope he proves me wrong ....,13,0,1617680174.0,None

t1_gthyjnf,gy356db,"Get it to Kanchanaburi and I can get it in. I got 140 rattan chairs from Ikea into the country. Needed then on short notice after our Myanmar supplier cancelled our order a week before our big grand opening. No one in Myanmar could fulfill an order that large on such short notice. Thankfully, Ikea could, and they were right over in Bangkok. 

Problem was, import tax on rattan furniture of really high in Myanmar, to help the local producers. These chairs were already twice the cost of our original order, and all the import shit would have added another 40% to that. So we made some arrangements with a driver and gave him plenty of gifts in beer, cigarettes and whiskey to give to the border guards at one of the most remote border crossings where they can't just go by that stuff during their lunch break, these guys only go home once a week. That was that.

140 chairs arrived as if they were purchased right in town. I can get the equipment in. 

Unfortunately the military just outlawed satellite dishes though, so placement once in the country is more the issue then getting them in.",1,1,1620991304.0,end_pun_violence

t1_gtig48c,gy31is3,"That was a business decision which provided a financial benefit. 

This similarly, could be a business decision which provides a financial benefit.

The Bolivian situation was slightly more nuanced with a large number of supporters for both governments around the world if I remember correctly. Whereas the Myanmar Military id universally viewed as evil around the world. UN fact finding missions have found them guilty of genocide on multiple occasions (two different ethnic groups) and committing crimes against humanity. Only reason there's no UN coalition on the ground is because China didn't want to anger the military, as they are currently guarding gas pipelines that run into China, which have been targets for activists, and Russia wants to keep messing money selling them arms, and unfortunately the two countries that benefit the most from this also happen to be two of the biggest seats in the UNSBut yeah, otherwise, these guys are seen as evil around the world and if Starlink could say that one of their first major uses was tookeep democratic activists connected to each other and to the outside world amidst an authoritarian internet blackout by an illegitimate government... Well, I'm pretty sure returning freedom and democracy to a country and preventing further genocide there is certainly one way to win over customers and get the money rolling in.",1,1,1620988583.0,end_pun_violence

An article of this sort

""On the military junta last effort to censorship the Burmese billionaire filantropist, demigod Elon Musk provided resistance protestors with solar roofs power walls and starlink internet free of censorship to open a window to the world. Showing us the brutality of the junta."" 

I mean... You can't get for a couple of sat dishes and few thousand dollars of equipment this kind of press normally. Search puerto rico huracán maria and elon musk he provided some solar panels, enough to take credit. And offer to be the contractor fo the us to rebuild the islands energy grid.
