t3_ndqmhm,gyfjtv5,These dirt bags have been doing this to Rohingya people as well. I never understood the the concept if you hate a group of people and can't stand them how the hell do you have such sickness to commit these crimes against them. I hope once you as a people over this come you stand up for the Rohingya this time against these despicable crimes. And this might sound violent but you as a people should find every solider who did this once you get your country back and do this to them as well with a hot iron pole.,2,0,1621249457.0,kudurru_maqlu

t1_gyc0aew,gyc4d91,"That's the problem. The military's indoctrination goes beyond the defense service academy. Children in rural areas are taught from a young age that Buddhism must be protected at all costs, and the military makes themselves out to be Buddhism's last line of defense. And they depict the opposition as the sinners who are to be hated and are less than human. As such, as long as one believes he's doing the greater good in the grand scheme of things, and all his sins shall be cleansed as long as he keeps his faith.",12,1,1621180965.0,Levi_Ackerman2512

Or cats torturing mice they don’t eat before killing them? Or lions killing off all the other male lion cubs in a group they take over and raping all the females?

t1_gyfjtv5,gyo79dm,of course the perpetrator of these war crimes should be held accountable according to the international laws and human right regulations. It is terrifying how far the human aggression and hatred can go without a proper example Off suitable punishment.

t1_gyc6wh8,gyc89y8,"Well, there are two kinds of police in this context afaik. There’s local police, who live among the people, albeit in segregated neighborhoods. They usually try to minimize casualties because they’re friends and family with the locals, and then there’s police platoons trained similar to the soldiers, who are stationed in camps and then mobilized around the country.",7,3,1621182782.0,Levi_Ackerman2512
t1_gyeu575,gyfe81y,"Definitely. Most people wouldn’t say animals are evil since they don’t know any better, but humans do, and yet they still chose to be cruel. In that sense they are certainly worse than animals. 

On the other hand I don’t really like to see people saying animals are completely innocent while humans are evil in nature. As a whole, humans are almost certainly the most cooperative and empathetic species on this planet. We provide for our weak and have laws against injustice. I think it’s important to remember that the Junta are the unnatural ones. They have overthrown law and order and violated basic human rights that the rest of humanity has agreed to respect.",1,3,1621244917.0,InkonParchment
