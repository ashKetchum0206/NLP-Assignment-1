t3_lwpl71,gpjhmd9,"Pardon me for saying something stupid, but i think your “peaceful protest” are not gonna work.

You need support from military and police (A LOT of them) that willingly support your movement in order to ease your peaceful protest.

Indonesia has same problem in 1998. Suharto’s “New Order” regime (Orde Baru) are behaving the same way like your military and police do (they shot and killed 4 students at May 12, 1998 protest and probably staged mass riot in Jakarta that kill a lot of civvies). 9 day after that incident, Suharto finally resigned after getting pressure from some high ranking military officer that demands his resignation. Thus ending the 32 year “New Order” regime.

If you don’t have support from some military and  police, i’m afraid that armed resistance is the only way to get rid of that regime. Because right now the world clearly doesn’t care about your plight (they’re more care to HK protest than yours)",39,0,1614784586.0,CouchPotatoID

Apparently, these police officers were given no meals by their overlords and that's why they have been stealing food. Basically, they're being worked without any food. They beg for food from protesters then beat them up shortly afterwards without a shred of mercy when the ""order"" comes. They were intentionally left hungry to cloudy their judgement and make them angry.

They cover license plates and reuse these seized civilian vehicles to disrupt protests since protesters could see them from far away and brace themselves for the raid. They drive close to the protest site, then get out, shoot at the protesters in an Al Qaeda style at close range, drag everyone in and drive away.

Sharing the news is another big way of helping the people and letting more people know about the reality of what's happening.

That means when you know who is in charge and  responsible for this kinda chaos, twisting the roles of military and police into this distorted version of itself. You, even some random dude in a far off country can effect the ""leadership"" of someone who hordes power...because you know...**""All roads lead to Rome"".**

Use your **creativity and imagination**. Me personally would rather the ""leadership"" who sign off on this crazy would go for Therapy.

I dont know man, I dont know who figure running around headshotting people inspires confidence in their leaderships skills.

Lets think out of the box.

For example, you can document all areas where ""head shots"" and murders took place againts the citizens. Than take note of the nearest police and military stations where this was committed. 

With that knowledge you already have alot to work with. 
Heck simply passing that knowledge around would create a butterfly effect. I am sure there is alot of bored Reddit users around.

Anyway. You dont have to go out for blood, **think Like Batman**,  think of this situation like an **Onion**. Those who are trying to preserve their position do it likely for personal security and safety, in a deeper level its fear. **They are using the police and military** as a cover. You gotta go deeper. Remember the people in the military and police are Human Beings as well. That means they are a mixed bag. Those who are trying to preserve their status will try to get the military and police to be on their side, as if its a **shared fate**...when really they really should go for Therapy and counseling.

Self Defence people. When you face someone so blatantly disregarding their own humanity and yours, Self Defence reallllly helps....

Hope this video inspires you.
There is a time and place for everything.

Edit:

Arh...Servant Leadership...more ❤ less head-shots of citizens.👍

Side edit: 

I wonder if the police and military personal of Myanmmar  took the time to pause and really reflect on what they are doing to their own citizens.

Is any of this really base on Truth? Or are they all getting drag into some dude version of his reality.

Yeah, I know your police aren’t there to protect you, that was literally my point. They brutalised the American citizens and your guns did nothing to help you. The entire world saw this. 
I’m not here to tell you to fix your gun control problem, it’s your country you can do what you want. If you want to keep shooting each other then what business is it of mine. But don’t pretend guns actually help against a tyrannical government.

 You’re currently living in a police state and you’re to scared to shoot back. It’s a low bar to set when you have to compare yourself to Myanmar and say “well at least we’re better than that”. You use your guns on unarmed civilians, not to protection from the police.

Either could be true. Just take a look at the series of these tweets.

They dare not fight back against someone who is equally armed. In this tweet, a KNU officer, which is an ethnic armed organization that has entered a ceasefire treaty with the junta previously, pointed the gun at the police and forced them to release the protesters

https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-11.xls

Gun violence compared to “fists” is not even close, with firearms winning by a landslide. The whole “ swimming pools kill people so should we ban them“ is such an unsophisticated non nuanced way of thinking. I mean, if we are playing stupid games then I can join in. One punch can kill so should we cut off everyone’s hands? You have metal detectors at schools, you have a device used in war to detect the direction of gun fire installed in some of you cities, you have a mass shooting on average every day. Your country is renowned for its gun violence. 

Guns are literally designed to kill people, that’s their purpose, that was the reason for their inception. But like I said, regarding you gun laws, change them or don’t change them it’s up to you. It’s your country do whatever you want. But if we are pretending that you guys would use them for defence against a tyrannical government then you must be waiting for them to come slaughter you in mass because that’s the only thing they haven’t done. 

There was plenty video evidence of how the police behaved during the protest which later turned to riots. It’s not the first time you’ve rioted over police brutality by the way. There’s also plenty of video evidence dating back many decades of how the police treat your citizens. A vast majority of the time they have zero consequences, they may even get a paid vacation or a promotion. 

I’m not saying it was anything like Myanmar. All I’m saying is if we are comparing it to that it’s a low, low bar to set.  

If you don’t think you have to defend yourself against being shot at (tear gas/ metal cases in rubber), beaten, run over, abducted...then how free are you? Because that’s what they did. But if you’re okay with it then great. I just think it’s rich when Americans give advice on gun control.

Not all countries need to do this however, this is just to ensure pure neutrality when it comes to that country fucking up. So they choose to do it, or not.

t1_gr3pwf7,gr4ieza,I’m not sure how you can come to the conclusion that working with armed forces from your own country (for which Americans have no choice) who do bad things sometimes and working with another group (where we do have a choice) is somehow inconsistent reasoning. If you’re really not able to see the difference here then I think that’s a “you” problem.,1,4,1615904548.0,itsrecockulous
t1_gpl7d2i,gpl9fd3,"Ah, the old tanks, planes, drones against a rebellion. A black hawk cannot track and enforce underground movements, civil disobedience, active organizing, etc. A Blackhawk cannot track Dan and all his hundred if not thousands of well motivated friends who are fighting against a unjust military coup. Tanks, jets, drones can only destroy cities and neighborhoods. It takes police and military personals to enforce the coup. Nice hypothetical though. But you falling back to ""Blackhawks"" shows that you do believe police and military would think twice on doing what the Myanmar police and military are doing to it's people if they were armed. Thanks for finally answering my question, though it's sad I had to find out after not answering the question, changing goalposts, etc.

Also, a ""Blackhawk"" is mostly a logistics vehicles and not for actual combat though it can be used during those situations. You seem not to know what you're talking about unfortunately.",2,4,1614812438.0,weeman123
