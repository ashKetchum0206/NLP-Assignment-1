Sure, being watched on by neighboring countries as our people are murdered from an illegal authoritarian regime, and being constantly given political platitudes like ""We urge for an end to violence"" or other BS  while continuing to recognize the power-hungry monsters as the official government by our allies is ""no apparent fucking reason.""

Maybe try to understand that our people are angry and tired from the inaction of the ASEAN. Out of any other countries, the closest to us watch us as we die and struggle.
