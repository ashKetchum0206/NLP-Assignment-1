t3_lycsdn,gptf9b0,"Unfortunately, there is little foreigners can do since Myanmar is a sovereign state. The limited means include the usual sanctions, diplomatic protests, etc. This might works if the members of the U.N. are unanimous but as in many instances, they are not. So in this case, countries such as China and in ASEAN countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines are obstacles to any meaningful pressure on the coup leadership. Many, if not most, foreigners and their countries dearly wish that they can do more but limitations are there...still whenever there is opportunities, they will do what they can. Still, these terrorists will not go unpunished... the world will hold them accountable to the bloody and despicable acts against their own countrymen. Do not lose hope, you will succeed in the end... Also death is very useful as it will surely get rid of all dictators.",13,0,1614978397.0,zyytii

From the way you all throw the word ignorance around you’re all sure quick to claim you yourselves were ignorant of the Rohingya genocide. Funny how you use ignorance in your favor when it suits you, and then attempt to use it as a weapon when you’re called out.
