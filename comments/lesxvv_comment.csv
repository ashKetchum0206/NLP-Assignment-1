t3_lesxvv,gmipu38,The military has insulted the intelligence of the people of Myanmar and the international community for thinking anyone would fall for their blatant propaganda. We need people like this girl more than ever.,26,0,1612738438.0,holmes1001

t3_lesxvv,gmk5rfk,Could you post it in other online social media platforms such as twitter and facebook. Reddit is not ideal for spreading infomations rather than discussing it.

t3_lesxvv,gmj79w1,"Honest question. I am reading a lot of reports that the average Myanmar citizen is actually subjected to their own propaganda in that the previous leaders are actually not exactly shining star examples of great leadership. 

Not that the military is right in the coup, bc it sounds heinous, but that the prior leaders are in bed with China and that was a large part of why they ousted them. China forcing a debt trap to the country while making the previous leaders and their cronies rich.

So it almost sounds like two bad guys, one being the lesser evil. ""A pride of vicious lions vs a pack of hyenas"" basically. Thoughts?",5,0,1612747242.0,edcing

t1_gmj79w1,gmj97ht,"First of all I’d like to request not to call them as previous leader. The state councilor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the president U Win Print ( NLD) are still the leaders we accepted and voted. The excuse the military gave, for detaining them was a fraudulent in ballots which is an insult to us, since the majority of us actually voted for the NLD party. I think if you make more research, you will find out the military was the one who has always been kissing China’s a** and left the country in debt. The cronies are them. Their relatives and families are the richest in the country. They had took over the country consecutively in 1962,1988,1990 (NLD won election in 1990 but the military refused to handover) until 2011. (Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was under house arrest for 15 years and her members were in jail or in exile during those days).However, it was only in 2015 the NLD party won the second election and took in charge of the country in 2016. It has only been 4 years that the country has been really developing and it wasn’t even pure democracy since the military was still in charge for 25% of the parliament. But it was a lot better. The military left the country in China’s debt and the NLD has been dealing with them ever since. They are the true leaders and they are our only hope. I hope this clear up for you. The military is the nightmare and both lions and hyenas to us. If you want reliable sources, articles and books to make further research on this, please kindly let me know and I’m more that happy to provide you with references.
Thank you.

t1_gmj79w1,gmjazyj,"I think the guys in bed with China are the generals, Military got supplies from China and Russia, if I’m not mistaken. And as far as I know ASSK prefer to work with India over China. I’m not into politics so my knowledge might be wrong. Correct me if I’m wrong",10,1,1612749058.0,SanNuamSung
t1_gmj79w1,gmlo42l,"The National League for Democracy are the lesser evil, true they showed little spine by having ASSK trying to defend the military actions against the Rohingya  but not doing so would probably have made it even worse. Internal racism is rife in Myanmar, they are not a ‘union’ at all, but NLD is the best hope they have at the moment. But that issue will not be solved now, democracy needs to be the priority at the moment imho. In the future, they’re probably bette to be some collection of states / countries more on a EU style ... they have no common vision or cause and likely never will have. When so many ppl introduce them themselves as ‘Bamar’, ‘Chin’, ‘Shan’, ‘Kachin’, ‘Rakhine’ etc NOT as ‘Myanmar’ ... that says it all. And as usual, religion is another cause of trouble, ASSK does not want the Muslims either, she just won’t say it. One problem at a time. Now the military are sprouting BS with Bangladesh saying they want to take the Rohingya back ... they’re the ones who drove them out and committed genocide ! The country is a mess, but at least democracy was improving ppl’s lives and VERY SLOWLY heading in some sort of right direction. btw, the MMR education system is the worst I’ve ever seen anywhere in the world.",1,1,1612805489.0,MAI_AnDong

t1_gmkp2kb,gmkq0xq,"You're saying as if EVERY Burmese people support genocide... quite a big assumption right there.

It's no different than any other racist folks out there who stereotype 
""All black people are thugs""
""All muslims are terrorists"" .

Also,I think you're missing the point that the VERY PEOPLE who executed Rohingyas are in CHARGE here.
We,Burmeses aren't here to argue whether if ASSK is good or bad nor anything regarding the Rohingya crisis. We just don't want military dictatorship AGAIN. 

As to regarding to the genocide case, [here's ](https://youtu.be/5bDgDiBO4Co) a video I find helpful. It present both side of the arguement without biases and really Informational. I suggest you check that out.",3,1,1612787713.0,3ig_Chungus69

t1_gmj97ht,gmjaxmp,"Thanks for your information. Again, I am not familiar and it's hard to discern who are good guys in these types of situations since politicians are generally not the most honest people. That said, a lot of the West is having a hard time siding with any side, even Aung San Suu Kyi, because it appeared she either condoned or was ambivalent to the genocide of Muslims. Care to give your take on the genocide and her complicit attitude?",4,2,1612749026.0,edcing
t1_gmjazyj,gmlwbhf,"pretty good assessment, but if the west shuns Myanmar (and doesn’t realise that ASSK is largely working under the thumb of the military) then NLD have little choice but to take money from whoever will give it, she tries to reduce the debt trap measures that come with China ‘charity’.

t1_gmjkq9k,gmlqo4q,"everything is relative, 50+ million for the sacrifice of a few million Rohingya and relatively ‘small genocide’ (yes, that’s what I said !), sorry to say but the Rohingya issue is not more important at the moment. Majority of Myanamr are racist towards Muslims (if they were to be honest with themselves, which they will not be), but that problem needs to move to 2nd or later place at the moment. fyi, if ASSK were not a forced puppet of the military, or at least having to try to placate them as they essentially control the parliament by virtue of their 25% control, she may actually try to find a real Rohingya solution [she may actually even call them that instead of north Rakhine ppl (!)], as much as i don’t like it, she and the NLD are the lesser of the evils.
