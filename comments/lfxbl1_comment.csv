Khine was shot with BA-93.

 \----------------------- From Wikipedia----

The BA93 and BA94 are Burma-made clones of the Uzi. Production started in [Myanmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar) after 1991 when an Israeli delegation visited the country and supplied the [*Tatmadaw*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatmadaw) with Uzis.[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzi#cite_note-35)[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzi#cite_note-36) It also included the rights to manufacture the Uzi under license.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzi#cite_note-BA9394-37)

....

As of 2018, both weapons were renamed MA-13.[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzi#cite_note-KK-38)",1,2,1612867037.0,godofones

So pls click on my username and read answers to similar questions, understand the democratic transition process, who is in charge of what, when did the planning for Genocide started (NY times/WAshington Post investigations) and how it was executed (again I present UN documents/Council on Foreign Relations Reports) and understand the background.
