Dude, did you just take 3 seperate quotes and smash them together by using elipses to make a sentence that biden never said?  Holy shit.  Ya'll must be desperate.   


The transcript from the town hall doesnt even contain parts of what you are quoting here.  
https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/02/17/remarks-by-president-biden-in-a-cnn-town-hall-with-anderson-cooper/

>that seems pretty complacent no matter where you put the quotes/how the leftist news anchor justifies it     

Youre right, that would seem complacent...IF THAT WAS WHAT HE HAD ACTUALLY SAID.   


Here is the actual quote:  

THE PRESIDENT:  We must speak up for human rights.  It’s who we are.  We can’t — my comment to him was — and I know him well, and he knows me well.  We’re — a two-hour conversation.

MR. COOPER:  You talked about this to him?

THE PRESIDENT:  I talked about this, too.  And that’s not so much refugee, but I talked about — I said — look, you know, Chinese leaders — if you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been — the time when China has been victimized by the outer world is when they haven’t been unified at home.  So the central — to vastly overstate it — the central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China.  And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that.   


I point out to him: No American President can be sustained as a President if he doesn’t reflect the values of the United States.  And so the idea I’m not going to speak out against what he’s doing in Hong Kong, what he’s doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China and Taiwan, trying to end the One China policy by making it forceful — I said — and by the — he said he — he gets it.  Culturally, there are different norms that each country and they — their leaders — are expected to follow.    


But my point was that when I came back from meeting with him and traveling 17,000 miles with him when I was vice president and he was the vice president — that’s how I got to know him so well, at the request of President Hu — not a joke — his predecessor, President Hu — and President Obama wanted us to get to know one another because he was going to be the president.   


And I came back and said they’re going to end their One China — their one child policy, because they’re so xenophobic, they won’t let anybody else in, and more people are retired than working.  How can they sustain economic growth when more people are retired?  


MR. COOPER:  When you talk to him, though, about human rights abuses, is that just — is that as far as it goes in terms of the U.S.?  Or is there any actual repercussions for China?   


THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there will be repercussions for China, and he knows that.  What I’m doing is making clear that we, in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the U.N. and other — other agencies that have an impact on their attitude.",2,5,1614794657.0,None

At this point, the individuals in the military are left with the decision of who they will fight for, their family and communities, or the government of whom they understand their role as a low-paid tool (if the government generally strives for good, this is called service and can be quite admirable, if the government is looking to slaughter their family, this is called being a stooge). Then the government starts a logistical nightmare campaign against it's own guerilla citizens, opening themselves to a PR disaster and allowing their allies to reconsider their alliance. After a long and protracted campaign, none of the traditional spoils of war are available - the economy is a shallow husk of what it once was, the citizenry will never trust them again, nor mobilize in effort toward re-industrialization...as citizens have time to organize, the possibility of a coup arises....... and the list of projected outcomes continues to get bleaker and bleaker.

Riiiiiiight. Because nobody was influenced by Fox News or Breitbart or One America Network. Nope. The only people tricked by the media voted Democrat.

It's kind of weird that you put any sort of weight on coherence, when Biden's opponent said [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=trump+john+oliver+auto+predict&oq=trump+john+oliver+auto+predict&aqs=chrome..69i57.11498j0j7&client=ms-android-motorola-rev2&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:3282a1b0,vid:dBmyp75uIZQ,st:0).

>I didnt say trump was a good option (you assumed that).

No, I didn't. You stated people voted for Biden because popstars told them to. The only other option was demented, racist, and corrupt. That *should* have factored into your analysis of reasons why people voted for Biden. In fact, it goes much further towards explaining Biden's victory than your popstar hypothesis.

>I didnt mention Joe's stutter

You claimed he is incoherent. Aside from his stutter, what basis do you have for claiming he is incoherent?

>but ypure right it is hilarious

Now you're showing your maturity is as stunted as your intellect.

>And if i were to guess who has dementia between the 78 ear old and the 74 year old...id go with the older gut habing dementia (literally age related)

Age related, or age dependent? Rather than only looking at someone's age, most people would consider behavior, comprehension and speech when trying to assess someone's mental fitness. But doing that would lead to the conclusion that the guy who thought clean coal was coal that had been washed, the guy that thought people could fight COVID by drinking disinfectant, the guy that wanted to nuke a hurricane was exhibiting far more signs of cognitive impairment. You overlook all that because one guy is 4 years older. But, you don't like Trump and are just trying to be objective. Sure.

And you're proud of this. Amazing.

Regardless, you still haven't addressed my initial points. Because you know I'm right and you're avoiding it.",0,1,1614816787.0,None
t1_gpkfbnm,gpkgh3g,"You claimed he was incoherent. I asked you for proof. You say there's lots of proof, but you haven't posted any. You just keep mentioning his age, as though that is proof. If age alone is indicative of cognitive decline, why are 80 year old Justices allowed to remain on the Supreme Court?


Have you given up on your attempts to link Bush's invasion of Iraq to terrorism? Or is that another case of there being so much evidence you won't post any?",0,1,1614799633.0,PuxinF

t1_gpkh3q4,gpklqry,">I dont agree with that either dumbass why are you trying to predict everything about me?

The irony of someone who spews nonsense about Iraq and 9/11 calling anyone else dumbass is just too rich.

I didn't predict you would agree with 80 year old judges: I don't care if you agree with 80 year old judges. The reality is they are allowed to serve even when they are older than Biden currently is. You keep trying to prove Biden is incoherent by citing his age, but if age alone proves dementia, then not only must a current Supreme Court Justice be demented, but the proof of his dementia is posted on Wiki and nobody is trying to have him removed from the bench. It's almost as if society rejects your notion that being 78 means a person is incoherent.",0,3,1614801892.0,PuxinF

Except you have an 80+ year old on the SUPREME COURT (where they make complex decisions FYI) and a 78 year old in the White House, elected less than 5 months ago. So, when you say it's just me, what you really mean is it is just me and >80 million.

I don't know if you can wipe your own ass or not, but you're clearly incapable of making complex decisions. Should we label your whole demographic as demented?",0,7,1614813333.0,PuxinF
