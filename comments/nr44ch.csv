Perhaps well intentioned, the press has failed to take into account her character and the nuances appeal that was made in front of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). This article seeks to readdressing the legacy of this courageous woman in light of the recent military coup and her subsequent detention.

t1_h0fprtp,h0h6l4v,"That whole thing was completely twisted around to give a specific narrative.  

Many years ago they came into what was then called Burma as illegal immigrants that entered the country.  They are originally from Bangladesh.  They never bothered to obtain legal status.  Keep in mind this was several decades ago.  They demanded that the Burmese Government, at that time military regime, give them a pretty large portion of the northern part of the country.  The military regime refused.  So they went to the international stage to try to get countries to support them and force the military regime to give a large portion of land to them.  No nation would support what they wanted.  

So after years of trying.  They started to resort to any tactic possible.  They even received gorilla like training from terrorist groups, like Al-Qaeda.  Then they started to attack non-muslim people.  This fact has been ignored by the media, mostly Al Jazeera, which is a very bias news network.

Fast forward to about 5-6 years ago when Auntie Sue and the NLD won a fair democratic election, they saw the opportunity to once again spin their story to try to get the NLD and newly elected leaders to recognize the Rohingya as citizens of Myanmar.  Of course the newly elected leaders refused.  So they started attacking people again.

What the media failed to report was that the Rohingya were attacking non-muslim citizens.  But Al Jazeera reported it as the military under the new leadership that was killing the Rohingya.  Even the story that 60 minutes ran about it was severely inaccurate and followed a false narrative.

When it first happened, you could find articles about all of this but since Al Jazeera got involved with reporting on the story, all of those articles that talk about this accurately are no longer available and I could no longer find them.  However, I have not tried to find them in the last 4 years.  

FYI - I have close ties to many Burmese people who have validated everything I have stated above.",2,1,1622748643.0,TheSheibs

t1_h0gca96,h0gvrcd,"Hi there,

You asked me what I  thought about the comment that was left to you. I must answer and I admire you desire to find the truth.  After studying and reading the speeches of Aung San Suu Kyi, I must strongly disagree with that was said. She has made incalculable sacrifices in terms of her own safety and the ability to be with her family to stand up to the Army and bring democracy to her people.  

One of my dear friends had the opportunity to interview her when she first came out of house arrest in 1996. At this time the military would not even speak to her or her party. I would like to share a few of their exchanges. She is radically non-violent in her approach to truth and reconciliation as you can see below.

*Interviewer: In examining the crisis in Myanmar it is so easy to focus on the vast divisions between those struggling for democracy - the NLD-  and the ones oppressing's democracy - SLORC (this is the term used for the military dictatorship). Perhaps it is a premature question, but are there actual places  of goodwill and trust between both sides - areas where you find connection?* 

*ASSK: I would like to think there are but we have not been given the opportunity to find out. This is why we say dialogue is so important. How can we find out if there are places where we can meet, issues on which we can work together, unless we talk to one another? But I heard a rather shocking report about on of the SLORC ministers by a foreign journalist. The minister said you can do anything with money. If you hold a ten dollar note above a grave, a hand wll come out to reach it. And if you held out a hundred dollar note, the whole body would come out."" That seems to indicate that they have no principals whatsoever. If they think that everyone can be bought with money that is a shocking revelation.*

*Interviewer: In South Africa, Archbishop Desmond Tutu is leading the council for truth and reconciliation. Already the former Defense Minister under the apartheid regime has been indicated for his complicity in the murder of 13 people while he was in power. Now, if we were to put ourselves in the mind of SLORC's main players - I would think that fear would be a legitimate concern. Won't the people seek revenge after democracy is won?*

*ASSK: I think here SLORC underestimate both the people and us as a movement for democracy. Obviously there is some hatred among the people, especially those who have suffered. However we are confident we can control this hated. But there is no hate among the leaders of the NLD. The authorities find this difficult to understand.*

*There are so many in SLORC who feel strongly against Uncle U Kyi Maung, Uncle U Tin U and even U Win Htein (Aung San Su Kyi's personal assistant who spent 6 years in Insein Prison and was rearrested on 21 May 1996), because they are ex-military men who were actively involved in the democratic process.* 

&#x200B;

*I think SLORC's reading of the situation is this: If these men, who themselves were in the Military, are opposing them, it must be out of vindictiveness. I do not think it occurs to them that these ex-military officers are supporting the democratic movement because they believe in certain principals.*

*It goes back to what I told you about waving a dollar note above a grave: people who think that anyone can be bought, that human minds and hearts are mere commodities subject to the laws of supply and demand, such people would not be able to understand other human beings who work for a cause and are prepared to sacrifice themselves for that cause.*",2,5,1622744078.0,Bgonderman1013
