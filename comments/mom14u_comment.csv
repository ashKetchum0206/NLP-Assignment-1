Maybe it has worked in some ways, not so in others, but the chinese and russian vetos are results of the state of geopolitics of the late 1940s. Stalin was in power remember.

t3_mom14u,gu8dsza,"Oh don’t be fooled that the problem lies only with Russia and China. Have a look at the veto records of the Security Council. The US has been very willing to veto anything in reference to its allies, like Saudi Arabia and Israel, or anything that involves its actions.

Again, everyone doesn’t understand that the UN is not the world government or police. It is not the global equivalent of the EU. It is merely an intergovernmental organisation that happen to be handed many many responsiblilities. 

The P5 are handed veto power in the UNSC to encourage that they remain on the table. 

For UN to send peacekeepers into Myanmar, not only does the UNSC has to authorise it, but all parties in the conflict (that is the junta, all ethnic armed groups, and NLD/CRPH) has to also agree to it. 

The alternative is that the UNSC authorises full military intervention, which is unlikely. Because hardly anyone wants to risk troops to get in between what is now a brewing civil war.

Any military intervention at this stage will only make Myanmar’s future worse. Until a viable solution post-intervention can be achieved, we risk making Myanmar becoming Syria/Iraq. It pains me to say this, but the bigger picture is accepting that for a better future, accepting some will loss their life today is the unfortunate part of it.",6,0,1618213662.0,Worried_Sale_1051

t3_mom14u,gu7d8o1,"Western civilization has to have a whole rethink on the relevance of the UN now that it has been weaponized by the CCP. The UN, WTO and WHO have all been hijacked by an unelected despotic dictator leaving many nations vunerable to political and economic coercion.

It's ironic that an authotarian communist is allowed to vote as a member of the security council when he himself is attacking democracy an all fronts, in Ladakh, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Myanmar to name a few examples.

The world needs a Organisation of Democratic Nations to support developing democracies instead of being prevented from taking action by the vote  the very person who is undermining democracy himself.

We need to be guided by democratically elected leaders not despots like Xi and Putan who are at war with democracy from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. Time for Change.",1,0,1618188485.0,Significant-Day945
t3_mom14u,gu7us62,"You must be on a new level of stupid if you think world wars are defined by the death toll endured or that whether 100 million people were involved. A bit like your lack of ability to comprehend that modern warfare between superpowers does not have to involve them even firing one single bullet.

Just in the last few years CCP have invaded territory   or made military incursions in to Japan, Taiwan, Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia Vietnam and India, they also anexed territory in Nepal, Tajikistan, Pakistan. Then you have all the proxy wars in places like Syria, Yemen and Myanmar. 

Oh and then we got USA, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Australia,  UK, France, and Germany all occupying SCS . Not to mention cyber warfare or biological weapons. 

Sounds a bit like world war to me especially now that Germany are involved, a world war wouldn't be the same without Germany. So when you add Russia to the mix thats the 8 most powerful armies in the world.",-1,0,1618198222.0,Significant-Day945

Meanwhile Russia invade Crimea and the Ukraine, while China take the whole South China Sea, support the Tatmadaws war on democracy in Myanmar, threaten to invade Taiwan. As a coalition including 6 of the worlds most powerful armies prepares for a full blown military conflict with the PLA.

t1_gu7go1r,gu7mo3i,"Haha. That is not a world war, you must be new level of stupid if you think those are world war. World War 2 killed 70-85 million people in 6 years with more than 100 million people involved with the war. The current conflicts that you mentioned not even close to scratch the surface of the number in WW2.

But hey, don't let the definition stop you from justifying that UN doesn't work. Conflicts happened all over the world but if any foreign government just can involve with any conflict in any country, it will become a world war. UN had dampened that with many superpower can veto each other and stop each other from going full out war. If that doesn't work, i don't know what else would work.

Did China took over South China Sea? I must be damned cause i haven't see any attack on vessel go thru the area and taxes still collected by respective governments. 

I never discounted that UN need to do more and there are efforts being done to do exactly that. It is very tipsy balance that need to be managed and it is a very delicate things that need to be pushed forward.",7,2,1618193607.0,vlkscode

t1_gu5msmq,gu8jyrr,"actually, Russia is also one-party with uzurped non-democratic power. They still even worship Lenin's mummy in ziggurat in the main square of the country. All main authorities are either from USSR regime or are Putins old friends from Saint-Petersburgh organized crime groups. Putin dreams to reunite the USSR with coercion, thats why he invades neighbouring countries.

There has never been any communist state in the history, because communism is just a MacGuffin for uzurpers, that seize power from people. Such state lies to occupied people that they are doing something, that leads to a communism paradise in future. but today you should save half of your rice for tomorrow, the road to communism is hard..

As a result, there is no single communist state in world's history and never have been ever possible to create one. Russia has more free market economy and less government control (mostly because of lacking technology) but in general their regime is very similar to chinese: both are inhuman and seized power without transparent elections.

When I say that there should be military action against China for their crimes, I'm basing it off of the 1930s, when the Allies knew the Germans were violating the Versailles treaty and claiming land outside of their territory, and decided to try and appease hitler. It didn't work then, it won't work now. Military posturing in the SCS doesn't work, freedom of navigation missions don't work.
