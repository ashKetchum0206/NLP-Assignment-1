People who think the Americans are every-fucking-where and people who supports the right-wing nationalism by supporting and trying to justify all the mass killings. I don't think they really care about what's happening in this country though. They just need to see the proof that their conspiracy of the west backing us is true and they'd reassure their insecure asses that they are on the right side of the history.
