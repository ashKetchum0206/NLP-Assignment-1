t3_t1y3a0,hyjig82,"My perspective as a Burmese person living in America:

Ones an invasion by a foreign entity, the other one is a coup that most countries will consider ""internal affairs"" (like China). Governments around the world could definitely do more including sanction the junta, but they primarily do business with China who has very very similar ideological views. China would vehemently disagree with taking any action in Myanmar because if and when they have similar military action in Taiwan/Hong Kong, which in their view is China, they'll also consider it an ""internal affair"" that other countries shouldn't interfere with.

Another important point. In the eyes of other countries, if Ukraine falls then countries like Romania, Moldova, Latvia, etc. could also fall to Russia. The invasion spiraling into WWIII is a scary thought for most of the west. Compare that to the military coup which no doubt has its consequences but will very likely not affect the EU in any way (and will be isolated to Myanmar). Spoiler alert: countries only like to help when they have something to gain or when political actions could protect their future. Plus, Ukraine is right on Nato's doorstep, whereas Myanmar is an entirely different neighborhood.

Lastly, one of the biggest forms of support is the US providing military aid (in the form of weapons, planes, tanks, etc.) to Ukraine. There is still a stable government and military in Ukraine. Who would the US provide military aid to in Myanmar? Sure there are certain militaries and militias, but before this coup even began, everyone was fighting everyone. Providing arms to any group will just worsen things in my view, especially once there's a power vacuum.

None of this is to say countries have been doing enough, but comparisons like these and bringing in the race only hide the real issues at hand.",13,0,1645899348.0,Eastern_Importance,neutral,neutral,neutral

t1_hyjxmqt,i6v423z,"I know this is an old comment but, it strikes me that Myanmar, Hong Kong, Ukraine, Taiwan are all parts of the same war. The war of democracy against tyranny, the war of justice against fascism.

What struck me last year was the parallels between the Myanmar war and the Spanish Civil War. Both cases had a fascist junta taking power in a coup, supported by larger, more powerful fascist states (Germany and Italy/China and Russia.)

And then the Ukraine war started and I noticed a good few parallels between it and the Second Sino-Japanese War. And the odd thing is, that started around a year after the Spanish Civil War (8 July 1937 vs. 18 July 1936.) And the invasion of Ukraine started around a year after the Myanmar coup (24 February 2022 vs. 1 February 2021.)

Fuck those who say it's karma, I feel sorry for every ordinary Burmese citizen. BUT unfortunately, lots of people in Myanmar drank the propaganda kool-aid and believed that there wasn't a Rohingya genocide going on, and the world saw the denial. At least it seems like the majority of Russians know what's happening is wrong. It's one thing if Burmese were standing up to their military before the coup in terms of Rohingya + Kareni + others genocide, but they weren't. I understand that all ethnicities (even Bamar) have had struggles with the military, but as things started getting more free and better for Bamar people, it seems we forgot the atrocities the military has inflicted on us and had an ""all good as long as it isn't affecting me anymore"" attitude.

Now that the entire country is fucked by the coup, everyone wants to come to the side of Rohingyas and how we have always been on the same ""team"". Sure, we all always said ""fuck the military"", but no... most Burmese people didn't even believe anything was going on with the Rohingyas or denied it. Most of the Democratically elected government turned a blind eye to it in fears of sparking the military's outrage. 

All I saw before was denial of what was happening. I would occasionally see messages, even on this sub about how real the struggles the Rohingya were that they were going through, but they'd be shot down with typical propaganda... ""they're foreigners, they aren't Burmese, nothing is happening"". 

**TL;DR**: Just a mini-rant. Really wish more Burmese people would've stood up for the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities before shit hit the fan with the coup. Many Burmese people seemed to have forgotten about their history with the military and the pain they've inflicted as things got better, and turned a blind eye to the geocides.",13,1,1645901528.0,Eastern_Importance,negative,negative,negative

t1_hyjnt0g,hyk5hyn,"Dats true. This is caused by years and years of authoritarian rule and not getting true information but from state media information. I would say the burmese people were not determined enough back in the day as well as the ethnic armies. Dealings with the military have made them forget wat their main purpose was. Looking at u RCSS. No one wants to leave their comfort zone and we'll it didn't effect them that much cos it happened in a different region and not in the main city and in a place where Internet access isn't as good.

But you have to understand about the Rohingya case is that, I'm not sure if anyone has mentioned this, they were not mentioned at all in our history books nor did anyone knew about them. It was always the big ethnic minorities but never small ones. So u can imagine when Rohingya people were present this whole time in Myanmar, the older gen of Burmese people were livid and surprised cos they didnt knw that they existed in the first place. And they immediately concluded that they were illegal Bengalis who crossed the border.

Idk why but there is this fear mongering among some Burmese people and radical fake monks especially the old generation that Buddhism is being threatened by Muslims and they should protect it. It's so dumb honestly but some people buy it unfortunately. But what the current military is doing is way more damaging to Buddhism than an unknown outside force which may or may not come to pass. 

 ASSK should have protected the minorities and not the military. I think she partly knew that if she were to protect the Rohingyas and not the military, there would be a coup like now. But idk wat she was thinking back then or what her plan was.

I didnt knw much about the Rohingya crisis until later. There is diff between Ukraine and Myanmar situation and that is information and access to international media. Internet has been restricted with electricity not properly supplied to cities and in the country side which makes flow of information minimal. Ukraine however still has access to international media hence we get constant flow. We should not make this whataboutism in here. It's dumb and it's not helping anybody.
