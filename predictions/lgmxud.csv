t1_gmszs8y,gmt0p98,"Oh man. Short answer she's not responsible.
Long answer:

Burmese here. Always been critical of Suu Kyi. I think she's too stubborn but the international community seems to be under the guise that she's the one ordering the military and commiting genocide. She's not. Thing is genocide in Myanmar has been happening since WW2. it's not really an anti muslim thing. The miliary treats everyone minority and even the Burmese majority, equally by killing everyone. Doesn't really matter if your God tells you not to eat Beef or Pork. It just isn't a problem for them. Myanmar has the longest civil war in history. Still going on now but since other minorities in Myanmar aren't muslims, it doesn't sound tasty enough for the western media to report.

Situation in Arakan happens. The international community wanted Suu Kyi to condemn the military for genocide. 

It's really not simple as that.

She seems to be the leader of the country but she doesn't have much power. The whole constitution was written by the military and to prevent her from becoming head of state, the president and commander in chief of the military. But some lawyer dude called U Ko Ni, a muslim, found some loopholes and it gave her position of National Chancellor. (Translation of the position might be wrong) It did give her some power but zhe actually is powerless when it comes to the military.

The muslim lawyer, U Ko Ni, was shorty assassinated while holding his grandchild in the largest airport in Myanmar. It's most likely the military. Well tbh, everyone knows it's the military but still now there is no one important behind bars. The military virtually operates as a seperate entity and answers to the military commander in chief, Min Aung Hlaing, the guy who took power now. They don't need to listen to ASSK according to the constitution that they wrote. The military are owners of a lot of conglomerates too. 


I like to think ASSK was simply trying to get on their good side because if ASSK actually didn't defend the military, the coup would have happened even much earlier for reason the military would make that ASSK is dividing the country, belittling its own military and just took over. The constitution that they wrote allows them to do so. For Suu Kyi the little progess that has been made would be wiped out. Not defending the military would have just put the country, its people and even her in a precarious situation. She just got some power and trying to implement change after 20 years of house arrest. It would have been stupid of her to not defend the military. But It's always been military with the actual power even with Suu Kyi apparently in charge. I assume they just got tired of working things around her.


Why you might ask is the military taking power even though they hold most of it? Well, they probably got tired they don't hold all of it and ASSK is not comprimising and working with them. That sounds nice but it's important to work with the military. She has to but she's too stubborn.

The reason I think the coup is happening now is most likely because of MAH wanted to become president. The military would still be in power even if he retires but it seems MAH doesn't really want to let go of his power. (mind you, no official source is reporting this yet but this is a very likely possiblity and probably the most plausible) Since in the constitution that they wrote, he had to retire at 65. He turns 65. Suu Kyi probably refused to make MAH president and MAH just said ""fuck it"" kidnapped everyone and took power without a single drop of blood. All important positions have been replaced and now he is the head of everything. Like in the old days.


(Edit: it's kinda accepted knowledge among political pundits now that MAH wanted to be president and work something out with ASSK. ASSK refused. So now we are here. God, she is so fucking stubborn.

Update 2: MAH just moved into the presidential residence. Fucking cunt.)",16,1,1612956302.0,Zarni1410,negative,negative,negative

But I do know that if you are a member of ""unofficial""  ethnic groups (eg; Burmese-Chinese), then that affiliation is marked on your pink sheet (or passport), and you will be required to go through a different desk.

I guess if you are a ""Kalar"", you have extra steps to go through as well. I myself am a Bamar ( Buddhist on paper, don't practice it in reality) and have seen LA-WA-KA officials screwing around with Muslim candidates at Lamadaw office, which is fucked-up.
