The ""Right to Bear Arms"", not ""small arms"". The people need to have comparable firepower against potential coup makers to ensure that we don't ""easily slip back to coup situation again"". Why should we be limited to small arms while the military has mortars, artillery, tanks, helicopter gunships, fighter jets, and more? 

If you'd trust the people with small arms, perhaps with emphasis on personal responsibility, why not anything more powerful? In my opinion, to be truly free as a people, we need political power (real democracy), economic power (free markets that are actually free) and martial power (weaponry and training). None of these three will be achievable if a certain group of individuals (i.e. the generals) has exclusive access to a power (e.g. heavy weaponry and vehicles).",1,7,1643890534.0,twicedfanned,neutral,neutral,neutral

And yet, all these conflicts stem from something other than simply being armed. I live in a country where such weaponry is heavily regulated, but also where a mere outfit of soldiers like the Arakan Army can rise up and form a formidable fighting force that the ruling junta is wary of.

>The central premise of a state is that it has the exclusive rights to legitimate violence within the state border.

You're in a subreddit for a country where that very central premise has lead to a bloodthirsty junta that is very much willing to destroy their own populace to maintain their death grip on power. 

>The moment that idea is put into practice, dozens of heavily armed separatist movements start, which in addition to making it impossible for the government to do any governing...

""Governing"" where the central government's authoritarianism was and is forced onto ethnic minorities, leading to said ""heavily armed separatist movements"". As both Shan and Taiwanese, concepts such as independence and self-determination are something I hold dear. However, these very concepts are detested by heavily armed groups called ""governments"", who threaten me and people like me with violence if we are to pursue such concepts, even if done so peacefully to the maximum extent possible. 

Yet, instead of determining that it is these ""governments"" that need to have their ability to coerce stripped, you'd rather that we, the people, be defenseless and submit ourselves to them, with their ""exclusive rights to legitimate violence""?

For all their talks of a rifle behind every blade of grass, the Americans were extremely stingy with supplying the Nationalists with free or cheap weapons.

t1_hvioz97,hvki9np,">the state has ""exclusive rights to legitimate violence

That's the political science definition of the role of the *state*. The people who happens to run the state is the *government*, which the junta is. Every state in existence has this rights. If you ask, how are states determined to be legitimate or illegitimate? Well, states recognize each others as legitimate, that's it.

>As if the PDFs are engaging in ""illegitimate violence""

Your NUG is not recognised as legitimate by anyone, with the exception of nosy states like France. Other than that, not even th USA recognises the NUG as the legitimate government of the State of Myanmar. By definition, the PDF, which are not even under the NUG's command, are indeed engaging in illegitimate violence, from an internation system state point of view. In this system, Taiwan is also not a state in the United Nations or the international system. It has a government that is ruling the land area that is called Taiwan, but it is not a state.

The Tatmadaw is engaging in what can be considered as war crimes.

>That's the action of the government, and not necessarily a proof that the principle is wrong or unworkable.

It is proof that said principle is just that, a principle. From your comments, it is a principle where the legitimacy of  violence is not derived from a government's actions, but merely because it is the ""state"". It is a principle whereby violence by the state is considered ""legitimate"", even if it amounts to war crimes.

>The various EAOs, formidable as they were, were just enough to secure the grounds in their home territories with some contestation. They haven't been able to march onto the capital yet.

They may not have yet marched into the capital, but neither has the military been able to defeat them after nearly 70+ years. Yet, none of that matters when their existence alone suggest unresolved issues that stems much from the central government's heavy-handiness and a refusal to share power and establish a federal democracy. But hey, let's ignore that because the EAOs haven't marched into the capital yet.

If so, the ""legitimacy"" of violence has little practical meaning and may as well be substituted with ""state"".

Myanmar is less developed politically today than where China was in 1938. Nobody in the whole wide world dare to give its citizens ownership of military heavy weapons, even the most fanatical firearms ownership rights state. For an undeveloped country to want that requires a lot of delusion.

I'm not telling you what to do. I'm merely telling you the likelihood of success and the likely outcomes. What is most likely to happen is that the EAOs gain a bit more than what they had before the coup, but they aren't marching on the capital. The junta will end up with a bit less, but they aren't falling. The war will stalemate and there will a new equilibrium.
