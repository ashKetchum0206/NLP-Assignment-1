t3_ubj6z9,i68gfdo,"The photo is from 1935, when a group of Kayan women were brought to London. 

Kayan is one of the ethnic groups from Karenni (Kayah State). The rings themselves are a long spiral and it does push down on the shoulders. It is possible to remove the rings even after many years of use, and quite a few women have done so. The tradition is fairly rare amoung younger generations now, the place it is more common is among Kayan refugees who moved to Thailand as Thailand setup a number of tourist villages where they are described as a hill tribe. 

In Karenni it's mainly only a few of the older generation who still wear the rings. Though the situation in Karenni State is pretty bad at the moment as it is seeing heavy fighting from the civil war.",11,0,1650953849.0,The_Mister_Re,neutral,neutral,negative

t1_i64afop,i65ise6,"We speak the same language but they're seen as a different culture. We call them 'khu-lee' and ourselves 'Ka-yah'. In English, apparently, they grouped us together and my mother got confused about why they would call themselves Karenni. The defining differences come down to traditions. I honestly don't know much about their traditions because they lived in a different region. 

The only time I noticed them around was when some old lady decided to walk to the store or something. It's harder to tell the men and younger generations apart because old traditions were dying and the men didn't dress differently. Those clothes are uncomfortable too, it feels like wearing sandpaper.

Also, 'Kayah li' translates into 'Kayah alphabet' (Which I have never found a use for in my life, even our main written language is Burmese) or 'Kayah red', the red feels kind of unnecessary because nobody other than ourselves calls themselves Kayah.",5,1,1650906548.0,None,neutral,neutral,negative

t1_i651uz6,i65goym,It's a choice to wear them. Although tourism and the income it brings influences women on the Thai border to continue wearing them since they can't get other jobs as refugees.

t1_i65h6fz,i65imyb,"Well, the thing is, for kids it's just a simple necklace. Sometimes only 2 to 3 rings. It isn't tight. And that is if they wish to wear it. How many rings you wish to add as you grow up is kind of up to you. The rings you see on kids are pictures of Thai tourist traps. so it isn't a cultural thing to make kids wear a lot anymore. Plus, many have stopped wearing them in most part of the country because of practicality purposes, many sold their brass rings while fleeing civil war. In fact it is usually the owners of tourist traps that ""encourage"" the women to keep wearing them for more tourist money. And since most of them are refugees, they can't exactly go against what the tourist spots want since it is usually their only source of income. Its kind of ill informed to say that the culture is ""forcing"" it upon the younger ones when many in the culture are already reasonably wearing it or giving it up. Instead we blame the culture even though the ones that make headline news are the ones from tourist destinations who were made to play up their tribal factor",7,5,1650906491.0,HelloPeopleImDed,neutral,neutral,neutral

t1_i65jte5,i65lhwf,"Ah sure. Trust Wikipedia. Bruh, I have relatives from similar Kayan tribes, none of them still wear it anymore and I haven't heard a single one being forced to wear the rings. It isn't the same as religion where you'd get smited for removing the rings. It's just tourism that is making them continue to wear it to the extreme because of the business practices of these ""long neck village"" tourist traps. 

Since you love Wikipedia so much

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayan_people_(Myanmar)

""The government of Myanmar began discouraging neck rings as it struggled to appear more modern to the developed world. Consequently, many women in Myanmar began breaking the tradition, though a few older women and some of the younger girls in remote villages continued to wear rings. In Thailand, the practice has gained popularity in recent years, because it draws tourists who bring revenue to the tribe and to the local businessmen who run the villages and collect an entry fee of 500 to 600 baht per person. 

In January 2008, the UNHCR expressed reservations about tourists visiting the Kayan villages in Northern Thailand due to the provincial government’s refusal to allow registered Kayan refugees to take up offers of resettlement in developed countries.[11] It is believed this policy was linked to their economic importance to the area. This policy was relaxed in late 2008 and a small group of Kayan have left for New Zealand in August 2008.[12] Others entered the main Karenni refugee camp (which is not open to tourists) in September 2008 and they are now eligible for resettlement.""

"" Ma Lo, one of the women that removed her neck ring attested to the fact that the owners of the village usually cut down their wages if they do anything modern. In her words, “They say it ruins our traditional image and tourists won’t pay.”
Many Kayan women live with the hope that they will someday escape the neck ring lifestyle and migrate to a different place where they can experience a new-found level of freedom. For these women, the Kayan tradition makes life hard for them.""

I'm not saying it's good to wear the rings. I'm just saying that you are hating on a culture and pretending like the culture demands they still force kids to undergo it when it is the civil war and tourism that is influencing that. Its like hating English people and pretending like children are forced to wear corsets just because people wear corsets at a convention or in movies.",16,7,1650907577.0,HelloPeopleImDed,neutral,neutral,negative
