1. If anyone has been arrested alive at night, next morning only the dead body will be returned.
2. If you are a medical staff and helping injured protesters, then you will be arrested and tortured or get killed. 
3. Doesn’t matter you stay home or you go out for protesting, you can get killed anytime without any reason
4. Doesnt matter if you are a pregnant lady or you are a 6yrs old baby, you can get killed anytime without any reason

If a countries was democratic (like Thailand, Myamar, Russia) but change in dictator ship they go by vote of the member of UN 1 to the second UN. All the decision is made by vote of majority. The result is the democraric countries stay at the minimum of the some number than now  and can only increase.

History had taught us that when any uprising or revolutions in any country, those who raise up are the citizens and there usually be massacre and bloodbath along the journey.

No outside help came in either 88 or 07. This will also be the case now especially when the World is suffering from a worldwide pandemic.

The priority of the Govt of each nation, is to their own citizens and not with the citizens of another sovereign country. 

The higher the hope, the higher the disappointment when the hope does not materialised.

Despite the latest UN's statement, there are still Burmese who believe in R2P and that UN or a foreign nation will still deploy troops. They should face the reality that they are on their own.

It is their country, their democracy and their freedom.

t1_gtboljb,gtbw9og,"I think your best bet is to give CIA a call or ask China to send more weapons in return for BRI protection although they dont want democracy in their back yard they will gladly send a few more Aks and some ammo past it's expiry date for some môre gold, rubys and that nice jade you have up in Kachin. Just don't let them know it's for the NDL.

India is not going to help because the Tatmadaw are helping them to stop insurgents and seperatists attack states in NE India. 

The west cant leagelly do much with out a UN mandate which is not going to happen unless Russia and China suddenly implode.

Ironically the west don't want to commit troops cause they have just been through their longest war in modern history and don't want to divert troops from the coming war with China even though at this time Myanmar is infact the frontline and CCP are already surrounding India and are already in the Bay of Bengal.

So if you want more weapons you have to have a little chat with the Wa tribe who are the main distributors to all the other ethnic groups or have them secretly deliverd via a quiet beach in Bangaldesh. Perhaps some Islamic countries and ISIS may help a bit due to the Tatmadaw genocide of 24,000 Rohingya. So keep the anti Muslim retoric down because also theres alot of angery muslims in refugee camps in Bangaladesh that would like to have a crack at the Tatmadaw also and Im afraid you are going to need all the help you can get.

It seems that a steady supply of ammo is going to be a major issue for the NDL for some time to come but Im sure something wil turn up if you hang in there long enough and prepare to attack Tatmadaw on all fronts at the same time.

Bear in mind you also have Muslim militias and Christian militias that may have good contacts with arms dealers also. So you've got 100,000 trained ethnic troops, 100,000 untrained NDL and probably 100,000 Rohinga if you can make friends and promise to be nice. Now you gonna need 200,000 Aks and a very big barrel full of bullets..

I have much respect for ASSK but she did defend the military on the Rohingya genocide and some of your people even protested in front of US embassy in Yangon and said it was a domestic affair. 

All these are fresh on other people's mind. Plus we are now in the midst of a worldwide pandemic. 

China will not want US or Allies troops so near her border. Same scenario during the Korean War where China intervene and pushed back the Allied troops.

US will not want another unpopular war like the Vietnam war.

A Coalition force of at least a couple of hundred thousands of troops plus equipments need to be deployed to fight your military. 

Look at Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan now. 

Even Cambodia who last had a war 30 years ago, there are still land mines on its land.

No nations will want to risk a confrontation with either China or Russia over Myanmar which could lead to WW3.

UN cannot be deployed for various reasons and one of them is China and Russia will veto against it.

If Royhinga and Arakun attack the South West, Kachin in the North Weat, Wa and Shan in the North and West, Karen in the West and NDL in Central areas together with all the dozens of ethnic militias and perhaps ISIS fight with the Arakun and Royhinga as they have a score to settle with both China and the Tamadaw for the genocides if the Royhinga and in Xinjiang the Tatmadaw would have a very difficult time keeping control.

no shit. But it doesn't change the fact that chinese troops aren't in your country.

t1_gtbt78m,gtddii4,"I don't know what planet you've been living on, but here on earth the planet is crawling with PLA. Especially where CCP have important strategic BRI projects like the CPEC from Xinjiang to the defacto naval base in Gwadar and the Gas pipeline from Yunnan to the Bay of Bengal terminal in Myanmar. Right now PLA are massing 10s of thousands of troops and military vehicles in Jiegao/Ruili just across the border from Muse in Shan State.

It is no coincidence that CCP have just passed legislation giving the PLA authorization to protect CCP assets and personnel in other sovereign territories and also the Military Civilian Fusion Laws.

If there is an attack on the pipeline by ethnic militias and the NDL which in my view is inevitable the CCP will use this as well as the attacks on other assets that have already taken place on Chinese factories in Yangon to move into Myanmar.

The Tatmadaw are working very closely with the CCP in an effort to hold control and stop any possability of democracy developing on China's doorstep in my view an invasion of Myanmar is highly likely if not imminent within the next few months as soon as the pipeline is threatened.

I would not be suprised if the PLA even sabotaged the pipeline themselves to try and justify an invasion before the ethnic militias can establish a coalition with the NDL and become more powerful. Wait and see.

As for a proxy war it will be between China and India not the USA as PLA moving into Shan state will give them more influence in Kachin where they can open up another front and access to low mountain passes into Arunchal Pradesh which is Indian territory claimed by CCP, as well as gold, copper, ruby and jade mines and arable land which Kachin militias use to finance their fight against the Tatmadaw.

 They will also be able to work closely with insurgents and seperatists from NE India based in Western Myanmar giving India more headaches as well as obstruct Indian mining, infrastructure and investment deals there.

CCP wil also be looking to secure Rakhine State where the BRI terminal/ naval base is in the Bay of Bengal.

This scenario is highly likely as both the Arakun and Wa militias have agreed to join forces with the NDL,  PLA are supporting the Tatmadaw so CCP assets are far môre vulnerable to attacks.

USA and it's allies are not going to get bogged down in Myanmar. They may supply weapons and humanitarian aid to militias, but that's as far as it goes for now. They know this could be a decoy tactic by PLA to take the focus away from other theatres such as Taiwan and South China Sea so will not commit resources to a war they cant win. They learnt that lesson in Vietnam and are still trying to regroup after 30 years in the middle east.

The US public haven't got the stomach for another long drawn out war and are focused on internal issues, restructuring their economy and prepareing their military for the possibiliy of a future conflict with China.

As most people relise PLA try to avoid direct military conflict at all costs and prefer to supply other armies to fight there wars. The situation in Myanmar presents them with the perfect opportunity to move in useing the Tatmadaw as cannon fodder doing the dirty work keeping PLA casualties to a minimum while they consolidate their position and secure their assets in Myanmar

I'm sure Xi Jinping will see the situation in Myanmar as a window of opportunity to good to be missed. The alternative is for the militias to defeat the Tatmadaw, India to gain more influence and democracy right on China's doorstep. Surely the CCP are going to do everything in their power nit to let this happen.

And remember there are 2 million PLA in active service but also another 50 million X PLA up to all sorts of tricks. They are everywhere. Not to mention over 90 million CCP and their families, supporters and over a billion people and every Chinese company all living under the new Military Civilian Fusion Laws including CITIC the Chinese state owned conglomerate that is building the BRI port in Rakhine.",2,9,1617560951.0,Significant-Day945,neutral,neutral,neutral
