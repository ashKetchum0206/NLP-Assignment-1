t1_gr5n37k,gr5uqnq,"judging from the lower left currency being 冥通銀行 ""issued"", I think the rest of them are fake ""hell money"" as well. It's a kind of folk religion practice to give the departed currency to ""spend"" in the afterlife. Sort of like a coin on your eyes to pay the ferryman, except everything in the afterlife costs money too. Don't think about the hell economy and inflation too hard, it's a way for grieving family to provide for their loved ones and keep their memory alive.

t1_gr5n37k,gr7ycrh,"It’s called ‘Hell Money’. A Chinese tradition dating back centuries. Chinese believe the dead go down to be judged on their previous life and there are layers of hell depending on your sins/ merits.

Good souls can go to heaven. Some are reborn. Some souls have to stay longer. Don’t ask how long as no one really knows but they need money to buy food, services etc just like you would on Earth.

It’s not just money but figurines representing servants and maids are burnt, gold bars, clothing, housing, cars, latest mobile phones,etc are all burnt. All these items are made out of paper. This is so that they have a good afterlife.

This tradition is a mixture of aspects between Taoism and Buddhism which is practised to this day. The Chinese really respect and honour their dead even after they’ve gone.",3,1,1615973703.0,jwfc101,neutral,neutral,negative

t1_gr78y5j,gr7swsd,"Glad that you ask. It is a long story. I assume you are Chinese so I will explain Parallel to Qing Dynasty and the start of the century of humiliation. China has like the Chinese Chamber of commerce in Myanmar. It is the same as What the British did in HK and the century of humiliation. That Chamber of commerce as a  first-class citizen in Myanmar while we citizen of Myanmar are treated third or second class in our own country. They collude with the Myanmar military which is like the Qing dynasty who didn't dare to industrialize China because they will need to educate and empower the mass han population and it will be the end of their dynasty. So is the Myanmar Military, they didn't dare to educate or give democracy in Myanmar or it will be the end of military dictatorship. btw, Myanmar Junta hired an Israeli lobbyist with 2 million dollars. The money came from the Chinese Chamber of commerce account when it was traced. This group did all sorts of things to prop up Dictatorship in Myanmar in return. The junta gave him all sort of preferential treatment. They become first-class citizens in Myanmar. Whether it is mining jade or other resources it is the CHina who owns them all. It is like how British is the first-class citizen in Hong Kong. They start to pull like No Burmese allowed in their restaurant or business in Myanmar like How the British did in HK "" no Chinese or dogs allowed sign in HK"" in the century of humiliation. just Yesterday, a Chinese employer summoned a Myanmar employee to make a payment. but he didn't pay the promised amount and he called the soldiers to shoot the employees when they demand the promised amount. 5 deaths 70 arrested, 4 more death later. Chinese embassy and Beijing cover up all their corruption and neo-colony style dealing in their media in turn, they support the dictator in Myanmar. btw the Japan Chamber of commerce did the same. They tried to pull the same shit as the Chinese group did. But when the truth is surfaced, Japan's foreign ministry didn't cover-up. They give us Justice. that is the fking difference. also, the Chinese embassador to Myanmar is a fkiing corrupted shit.
