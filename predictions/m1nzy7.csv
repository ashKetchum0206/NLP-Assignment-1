t3_m1nzy7,gqf18fr,"The Israeli-Canadian lobbyist Ari Ben-Menashe is advising MAH to be anti-China. Israel is able to illegally occupy Palestine and terrorize the Palestinians because they have the support of the US. Similarly, MAH will want US support for the coup in return for Myanmar being a 100% anti-China. You see US allies such as “Saudi Arabia, UAE and Israel” mentioned in the Consultancy Agreement, so we can assume that MAH will position Myanmar as the US ally against China in South Asia. It will behave like Israel and allow the US a permanent military base in Myanmar, host US intelligence gathering units,  conduct assassination of high value targets for the US in South Asia [https://www.defensenews.com/breaking-news/2017/09/18/us-breaks-ground-for-new-permanent-base-in-israel/](https://www.defensenews.com/breaking-news/2017/09/18/us-breaks-ground-for-new-permanent-base-in-israel/)

Russia is mentioned as well as Russia is a key supplier of weapons to the Myanmar Army as well as UN Security Council permanent member. One of the biggest suppliers of weapons to the Myanmar Army that is not mentioned in the Consultancy Agreement is INDIA. That means that the Myanmar Army has already received confirmation from India that if they are Anti-China – India will support the coup and keep its border open for trade and continue to supply weapons to the Myanmar Army.
