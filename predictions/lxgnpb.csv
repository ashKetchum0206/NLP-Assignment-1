US kicked ass in Korea and Afghanistan. We got our half of Korea back and we killed Bin Laden.

t1_gppf4vg,gpph3u4,"Wrong, it is about control the production of oil. If Opec countries with conventional reservoirs produce too much oil, that will drive the oil price down and hurt the US oil industry which is dependent on unconventional reservoirs.

The overthrow of the Allende government? The imperialism of colonial Philippines? The gunboat diplomacy of pre-Meiji Japan? The destructive economic policies that essentially ruined countless economies, such as Venezuela's and some sub-Saharan African countries? The puppet regimes in pre-Castro Cuba? The failures of intervention in support of colonial France in Vietnam? Or the illegal war in Iraq? Ongoing support of an apartheid regime in Israel?

Plenty more to draw upon here. AMERICA. IS. NOT. YOUR. SAVIOUR.

Edit: let's not also forget that time America out stinger missiles in the hands of the Mujahideen... that went well for Afghanistan, didn't it?

t1_gpny3mj,gpo45um,"Actually that’s where you’re wrong. You act as if the actions of a few dictate the will of the many. Let’s use your German example. What the Nazis did during WW2 was undeniably wrong, however the German army as a whole is not guilty for what the Nazis did. The bulk of German soldiers were every day people that went to war for their country yet you let the few that were truly evil corrupt your view on them as a whole. Now look at what our country has done overseas in previous wars. Rape, torture, contributing to civilian deaths and deploying agent orange which has led to birth defects. Do you believe we are all guilty of these crimes? I’d argue we aren’t because the vast majority of our troops, just like the Germans, are people trying to get by in life and fought for their country. The Myanmar military vs the Burmese people as a whole follows the same concept.  “One rotten apple spoils the whole barrel.”

I’d also prefer us being involved in a conflict to help those in need vs being dragged into one over oil and fictitious claims. I would support a war like this just as the French helped us in the revolutionary war and we helped in both world wars, for the greater good of humanity.
