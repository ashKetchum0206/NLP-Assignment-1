t3_leh3ym,gmdsk46,"The only reason I know what is going on is because I have family in the country, and my wife and I are closely monitoring the situation because of how it affects us. 

But a good chunk of the world has no idea. 

Unlike the protests in Hong Kong, or even Thailand, what worries me the most is how this most likely won’t catch the hearts and minds of western media. 

Myanmar has an opportunity to be something great, but the protestors need to do something attractive to make the west want to listen and root for the people. 

I hate to say it, but Myanmar doesn’t have much going for itself at the moment that would immediately want westerns to flock towards supporting a protest that, if successful, could radically change the country for the better. Myanmar isn’t a top tourist destination like Thailand, and it isn’t a global financial center like Hong Kong. Instead, it’s a country that many people haven’t heard of, and those who have, know very little about. 

I’m not saying this stuff to belittle the protests, but instead, I’m saying this because I believe this generation needs to think outside the box, get the world to understand what is going on and what you are fighting for. 

The majority of the comments I keep seeing from those westerns who like to think they’re ‘woke’ is that ASSK deserves this. While most people subscribed to this sub clearly recognize how that is anything but true, it is important to remember that the media spent the last three years dragging her through the mud, instead of reporting on both sides. 

Either way, this isn’t really about ASSK, rather, the NLD, what it means, and what Myanmar has to gain. Tell that story to the world. Make them want to listen, and regain the sympathy that the Burmese, and the millions of ethnic minorities living within your boarders deserve.",23,0,1612689379.0,archer48,neutral,negative,neutral
t3_leh3ym,gmd76pv,"An alarming news have emerged that staffs from Union Election Commission (UEC) in Naypyidaw of Myanmar are being held at gunpoint by a group of soldiers from Myanmar Military.
The UEC staffs are being forced to make a signed statement to declare the election is fraudulent so that the military regime can justify the coup by presenting that statement to the United Nations(UN). 
The UEC staffs have also been told that soldiers are authorised to shoot if the staffs do not comply.

This is an attempt from military regime to forge a false information by threatening the life of the citizens. This violates the human rights, is unlawful, and should be condemned.

I don't justify that. You never justify genocide. What happened to the Rohingya people was horrible and there is nothing really people can do now to atone that other than to stop the oppressions against them and put on the trial the people responsible for the genocide ( even DASSK).

Now this is something no one can do with the military government in power. With a democracy instituted, we can at least have the chance of a political party coming in to reign ( after the NLD) that will acknowledge the genocide of the Rohingyas.

>All of you are saying the military is in charge in response to everything I’ve been saying. Well, they’re in charge NOW and people don’t seem afraid of protesting. So what was stopping you from protesting the Rohingya genocide?

Yes, there were very few to no protests for the genocide of the Rohingya people.[Any journalists who reported on it were jailed](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48182712)and any emotions of sympathy for them were shunned.

What was stopping you( the majority of Myanmar I'm assuming unless you can somehow read my mind) from protesting? Rising racial tensions and animosity towards the Rohingya seeded from military propaganda. Although I am sure that there were some xenophobic sentiments prior to the propaganda, [however the propaganda did make it more rampant and successfully influenced the majority of the Burmese people. (boycott facebook)](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html)

This is not an excuse however to our complicity to the genocide. We were complicit, that is true. There is no atonement to genocide.

[I believe and hope that during this coup, it is the opportune time for us to start realizing and acknowledging the struggles of the Rohingya people. Some Rohingya activists agree too.](https://time.com/5936604/myanmar-coup-rohingya/)

I am hoping that I am not replying to someone who thinks that the whole population of Myanmar deserves this just for their complicity. Or even worse, to die for their complicity. Fighting racism against racism isn't particularly smart.

The reason why I take issue with the sentiment of ""Good they deserve this, I hope the Military fuck them all over like they did the Rohingyas"", it is the irony and failure to recognize that the Rohingyas will STILL be persecuted and most probably worse under Military rule. The invoking of the genocide in that sentiment feels insincere and honestly seems just like a cover to parade their sadism and ""virtue"" . I doubt that people who truly care for the Rohingyas are happy that the military is taking over.

I hope you understand  the points I've made. I hope you respond back (if you do) with the intention to understand or to be understood rather than just to respond. I hope a lot.

It’s not that I wish the military to cause harm to everyone. Frankly, I’m indifferent to the cause where the average citizen belonging to the dominant group is concerned. I only care about people who are at risk of danger because they belong to an ethnic minority.
