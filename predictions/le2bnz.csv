Anyways it's interesting isn't it that there is no video clip with audio with the woman actually using her voice to declare that she and her fellow rohingya support the coup protesters? I mean to get someone as vulnerable as her to hold up her fingers isn't hard. Probably gave her some food, medicine or combination of the above to do that.

But hey at least we won't be sanctioned like north Korea. And this time the border has been sealed completely. I hope the people of ASEAN appreciate all the people being sent their way.

>Youre hurt bc of the Rohingya issue and want to lash out at everything. What a baby.

Yes we are very much aware of the problems caused by the rohingya exodus which is why the existing arms sanctions on burma have stayed. I'm not lashing out at everything just reminding people of who they're supporting. Our options aren't entirely limited and we have already developed low cost housing solutions for them. We know that they will not be repatriated, as we've already figure out the backstabbing nature of burma and her people. 

Now the sanctions will get worse and all burma will have are Russia and China. Those sanctions won't hurt the generals or their soldiers, they'll hurt the average burmese more. Because they'll go after the foreign private interests in burma. And the generals have said they won't leave and they're perfectly happy on a dependence on China. So I'm more laughing than anything really. Karmic justice and all!

You have to realize the coup basically stops any chance of rohingya repatriation which is perfectly fine with us, we knew that burma couldn't a honour a deal even if it's life depended on it. All this coup has done is confirm that the economic sanctions need to return. 

And the 2017 rohingya exodus actually did a better job of helping bangladesh get more foreign investment and improve our status. Products that Chinese, Japanese and Korean companies were going to produce in burma for the bangladeshi market basically got scrapped and now those companies are investing in bangladesh especially since we can drag our heels on regional economic cooperation.",-2,8,1612646674.0,lelouch312,negative,negative,neutral
