The army is there to carry out the elected politicians bidding on behalf of the people, not think that it is some political body able to govern the people to it’s will.

The army and to a certain extent police of Myanmar have totally lost this fundamental basis of democracy and they need to step back from the abyss that is a certain civil war with dire consequences for everyone in the region.

The elected politicians need to be freed, the army need to disarm and be ready for the wrath of justice as without any doubt it is arriving for the crimes committed against the people of Myanmar over the past decades let alone the past month.",1,4,1615912292.0,None,negative,negative,negative

You'll see the breakup of Burma, because the ethnic groups barely held together in the first place. Maybe that's what you want - Who knows. 

The Myanmar protestors are without a leader and they're running around like a headless chicken. The outside nations first need to call for dialogue without any threats.

(basically this is a provision so that a few countries cannot just team up and do whatever they want, the key goal of the UN is to prevent major wars like WW1/2 etc, so they can only really do anything if all major powers agree to it)
