t1_hnj433l,hnk9tt4,"That's true. I think I read that 3000 have defected already. Which is quite a good amount. But the lack of places to go combined with how risky it is is definitely a problem. Authoritarian regimes are making a big comeback but the issues with Myanmar seems to be that no one wants to get involved. And unlike the Taliban in Afghanistan, they(the Junta) have a way out by getting recognition. More recognition that The Taliban. ASEAN may recognize the Junta soon and that'll be....pretty bad. Cambodia's leader mentioned wanted to recognize them as legit just yesterday I believe. Many of the nations in ASEAN aren't free btw I feel that also may cause recognition of the Taliban and other extreme regimes, Who knows though. I think Myanmar will be in a true civil war soon. They have many groups training and many of the Rohingya who were getting killed by the Army before are now teaming up with other groups who have seen now for their own eyes how bad the Army actually is to innocent citizens. That's the thing about Democratic backsliding, the next step is sometimes war and then lots of turmoil and distrust and sometimes coups and *eventually* possibly maybe democracy again. Depends on a lot of factors though and they vary in each situation.
