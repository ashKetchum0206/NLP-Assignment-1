t3_r98iwg,hnbinvr,Ramming vehicles into protesters has seemingly become a tactic used around the world by fascists.

This is terrifying, I'm so sorry people in myanmar are being brutalized like this. The BLM movement in the US is a very different thing but the common thread is a belief in the rights of every single human to live free of terror regardless of where or how they were born.",8,1,1638731876.0,dragonbeard91,negative,negative,negative

t1_hncm8ib,hncnid0,Nope. Myanmar protestors are fighting a junta dictatorship for human rights. BLM is just rioting white teenagers with its Marxist founders with ties to the CCP. Don't ever compare your dirty BLM or any other American movements to the fight for justice in Myanmar. They aren't comparable.

t1_hncnid0,hnd0rud,"Bro you are being fed propaganda. They are trying to divide us against each other. I was at nearly every BLM protest in my city, and nearly every one was peaceful. Yet, I saw cops dragging 100% peaceful protesters onto the ground and throwing them in vans, slamming people with riot shields, pepper spraying when there was no provocation. And even if the crowds got rowdy at some point, the way in which the cops responded was always out of hand. For instance, the crowd would throw a water bottle into the line of cops and the cops would open fire with their crowd control guns, a totally disproportionate response. 

And to your point about the BLM organization: there is a difference between the BLM protesters and the founders of the “official” BLM organization, as there is always a difference between leaders and the grassroots of every movement. you can’t say that the directors of the BLM org represent the entire movement. The movement was a largely organic response to George Floyd and Breonna Taylor’s murder and police brutality in general, which is RAMPANT in this country. 

Our movements our stronger when we see the connections between them and forge solidarity. It’s not about making it about the US, it’s about building an international struggle against all forms of police brutality and authoritarianism. We are only weaker when we are divided, which is exactly what the people who have given you your information are trying to do.

Now, one final point, I will say that I agree with you that the CCP is in all likelihood attempting to influence the BLM protests in the US to their advantage, and Russia is probably doing the same, but they do this for purely cynical reasons and they are certainly not leading the protests. Their influence is marginal at best—they have a media arm and a couple of Maoist front groups they operate through, but these organizations are fringe and a joke to most people. 

And if anything is true, the CCP is trying to smear your movement in Myanmar! I sometimes read the propaganda websites that we have because I think it’s important to figure out how they are lying and spinning the truth. There is one that is notorious for defending human rights abuses in China, Russia, and Syria—it’s called Grayzone, if you are interested. And the last article they have about Myanmar is smearing your movement and independent journalists in the country, accusing them of being potential tools for a US imperialist regime-change operation. The implication of the article was that we should be wary of supporting protesters in Myanmar, because, they say, these protesters are probably just tools for the US government and they are being used to attack China and Russia. Now you live in Myanmar. I bet you realize how stupid that sounds! And yet that’s the propaganda that the folks who apologize for the CCP are spreading in my country. The way you are talking about BLM, it sounds like they must be running a similar operation where you are. It wouldn’t surprise me AT ALL to learn they are attempting to smear and discredit activists in the US to prevent international solidarity between our people.",6,4,1638733067.0,DangitBebby,negative,negative,negative

When these operatives from CIA or KGB supplied arms to various groups, it was for their own country's agenda. 

You mentioned that the Thai and Chinese borders are porous enough to fuelled ethic insurgencies for decades with weapons supplied. Has they make any headway in their fight for whatever they are fighting for? The Tatmadaw has been in control of Myanmar for decades and no insurgency has successfully dethroned them.
