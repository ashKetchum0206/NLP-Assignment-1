I won't wish you happy holidays because there is no happiness to find in the holidays for you this year.

It shows the scattering effect. In a missile strike, you have an explosion that breaks bodies and scatters them. In normal burning, you don't.

You can see some burnt grass that is far from the vehicles. In normal burning, you can't cross an area that has no combustibles. It must be an explosion.

[https://www.facebook.com/khitthitnews/photos/pcb.1384267532010589/1384267362010606](https://www.facebook.com/khitthitnews/photos/pcb.1384267532010589/1384267362010606)The two cars were targeted with guns from the gunship, hitting their gas tanks. The large area was targeted with a missile. You can see the discrepancy in burnt radii.

In general, I don't agree with the narrative of ""burning alive"" because that's so contrary to the goal of the junta. They gonna hold elections without NLD. They gonna rule. Burning random people alive is not gonna get votes. Let's assume that they did. There are still many problems with the narrative put forward by the KNDF. First, why would you burn them inside vehicles? You could have injured yourself with explosions from gas tanks. Just get them out. Second, why would you burn vehicles? You could have taken them home.",-12,0,1640423554.0,swh2021,neutral,neutral,negative

Shot in an engagement and burned as a form of cremation. Soros-funded DVB is spreading misinformation like crazy. I almost died back in 2007.

You think the goal of the junta is to have an electoral victory? And you think they will organize a free and fair election where it actually matters what the people think of them? They had that election last November and got their assess handed to them.

You can read all of this online it's not a secret. Unfortunately, Myanmar people aren't aware that most of their information comes from sources funded by the US government and globalists. 

I am thinking that the US strategy is now just to destroy the country so China can't profit of having a functioning neighbor. Better to cause a huge mess at China's doorstep. First they tried everything they could to keep the NLD in power and when they realized their client government wont be able to get back into power they switched to scorched earth policy.
