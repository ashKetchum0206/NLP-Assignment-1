t1_gtmu6fb,gtul4c5,"Uhmmm... Can I give my two cents on this whole China problem? Because it's been bugging me for a while... 

1. As far as my knowledge goes, China's reason for abstaining from UNSC's condemnation is due to how it would result to a global economic sanction for Myanmar. This, however, is not only ineffective, it is actually harming the common people more than it is the Junta. It has been shown how five decades of economic sanction only resulted in Myanmar's (then Burma) economy and politic getting isolated from the outside world, hence making it harder for any foreign sovereign nation-state to justify taking a meaningful action towards Myanmar. Simply put, Myanmar is far too isolated, no one cares. 

2. Even worse, sanctions would hurt the quality of the common people because there would be less investment, less job opportunites, less wealth for the common people to use for education, internet, and many other improvement for life quality. This translates to people not educated, not intelligent, not willing enough to fight against the junta. Both these reasons given by China are valid enough imho. 

3. Consider China's internal politics. China itself is an authoritarian government, hence they cannot ""openly"" support any democratic movement on foreign soil because such actions would only destabilize China, and China hates instability in their government. 

4. Myanmar is a direct neighbor to China and having an unstable, or even worse, a civil war state just beside you is a nightmare. China ""supports"" the junta simply because junta is the only faction that has the highest chance to stabilize the country. Hence, China's support for the junta. If the junta were to fail in the near future, then China would gladly support the next-in-line faction capable of stabilizing Myanmar. 

I'm not saying that China's action (or rather, inaction) is a good thing per se, but so far, China's actions have been extremely logical if not predictable.",2,6,1617911828.0,UsernameCzechIn,negative,negative,negative
