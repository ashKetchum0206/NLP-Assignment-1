Monday 7 September 2021 09:25 Hrs Myanmar Time

Our “Flash” Security Notifications are part of our Security Information Reports (SIR), available on a subscription basis. Please contact us at enquiry@exera.asia for further information about our subscription packages.
Today morning, NUG’s Acting-President Duwa Lashi La delivered a speech imposing the State of Emergency across Myanmar. The main takeaways are as follow:
 
1) From today 7 September onwards, the revolution against the SAC is declared. All civilians are to contribute to the best of their ability.

2) PDFs are to eliminate anyone associated with the military in their respective areas of control.

3) All SAC-appointed local civil administrators are directed to resign.

4) PDFs are to follow above instructions while prioritizing the public's safety.

5) PDFs are urged to put people's security first during operations.

6) The public is urged to refrain from travelling without emergency, gather supplies, and to assist PDFs.

7) Ethnic Armed Organizations are to launch offensives to claim their own areas of control.

8) Civilians are to assist in dismantling local civil administration.

9) Border Guard Police and Tatmadaw-affiliated People's Militias are urged fight the SAC.

10) The current revolution is a fair, and legal revolution.

11) The NUG believes neighbouring countries and the international community will understand.

12) All security personnel are directed to defect to PDFs immediately.

13) All civil servants are urged to refrain from going to office from today onwards.

14) Every citizen sacrificed during this revolution will be recognized as martyrs.
 
NUG’s Ministry of Defence also released guidelines to PDFs, urging them to behave in lines with international laws and not to commit war crime.
 
As of now, no significant incident has been reported across the country. However, a significant reinforcement of the security system can be expected. In Sanchaung Township, Kyuntaw Street is now blocked. The focus of security deployment is likely to be in Sanchaung-Kamayut-Hlaing-Insein area, as well as North Dagon-Tamwe-Thingangyun-Thaketa area. Bridges to Hlaing Thayar and Thanlyin may also be blocked.
 
Telecoms may be cut down. Panic buying might be expected in shops and markets. We recommend you avoid any movement; charge your electric appliances; review your communication processes; keep informed.",33,1,1631010902.0,cheap_as_chips,neutral,neutral,neutral
t1_hbw8g3k,hbwba89,"The best summary I could give is the battles between Ethnic Armed Organisations and the Tatmadaw has become more intense and frequent. (See also https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_conflict_in_Myanmar#2021_coup_and_resurgence_of_violence)

The most well-known EAO's are Kachin Independence Army, Karen National Union, Karenni Army, Karenni People's Defence Force, Chinland Defence Force, Chin National Front, People's Defence Force (formed by the National Unity Government), Arakan Army and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army.

Most EAO's stance is that they want to eradicate the military dictatorship, have equality between all ethnic groups, and establish a federal union. The Arakan Army is somewhat neutral to the situation (due to conflicts in 2018–2020) and focuses on achieving autonomy of the Rakhine State. They have established their own judicial system. The United Wa State Army may not help as they're basically independent.

Unlike any other places, most of Shan State is pretty much torn apart by a civil war between their own people, i.e clashes between North (Shan State Progress Party) and South (Restoration Council for Shan State). You also need to note that a few EAO's are pro-military.",8,1,1630991296.0,AmDed101,neutral,neutral,negative
t1_hbw8g3k,hbwc3so,"After coup, some of formal government NLD memebers and representatives gathered and formed NUG government at somewhere.In the same time, brave young teenagers which are known as Gen Z formed PDFs armed forces were formed with the help of EAOs like KIA,KNU, etc.. in each an every regions through out Myanmar. 
NUG and EAOs are also making contacts and negotiating to help and to fight JUNTA. At some point, they seem like made some agreements and EAOs decided to support and help PDFs. Since the main target is to rip off military spine for EAOs, NUG government, PDFs, they all came together as a one.

What I want to point out is that in EAOs there are sides and allies between them. Some are allied with China which basically means slaves of china, some are allied with military but some are just pure, brave EAOs like KIA,KNU,etc..

For AA (Arakan Army), I personally don't know what their purpose is. But they tried to stay behind the curtain at the beginning which is good for them and a bit suspecting. But we can't blame them for being like that cos there must be reasons.

U might be thinking that how many EAOs in Myanmar?
There are over 130 ethnic groups, 7 states, 7 major ethnic groups. So lots of EAOs.

 I hope I sum up enough for u to catch up.

t1_hbwjt34,hbwwroj,"The level of paternalism and condescending attitude towards Myanmar people is off the charts. You fundamentally misunderstand the mindsets of Myanmar people at large.

The NLD did not launch the CDM movement led my the medical sector on February 3rd- the Myanmar public did. It was the Myanmar people that took the initiative to start taking to the starts the following weekend after the coup, local community organizers and workers were the ones to do that. Millions of people didn't pour into the streets because Aung San Suu Kyi or U Win Myint told them to. When the military and police started to shoot people in the streets, it was the protesters that decided to first resist with makeshift barricades, shields, helmets and homemade weapons. CRPH did not take the initiative on that. Young men and women made the decision to respond to the horrific violence by the regime by forming their own armed groups. The NUG only responded to that demand for armed resistance and fully legitimizing it. 

Regarding the claim that people on this Reddit are local minorities, I don't really see evidence of that. Other forms of Myanmar social media like Twitter, Instagram and especially Facebook have been far more active in promoting the uprising and supporting it however they can. Almost every Myanmar person I know wants to see this uprising through to the end. And no, it isn't just privileged urban people and Myanmar people abroad promoting armed resistance and protests. The places that saw the longest lasting and most intense protests were many of the small towns, countryside and impoverished satellite neighborhoods of Yangon. The strongholds of armed resistance since the coup have been places like Chin, Karenni, Sagaing, Kachin and Magwe- not exactly places I would think of as being overly privileged. Hundreds of thousands of workers remain on strike- and many of these government jobs are not exactly glamorous either. The idea that the NUG is just exploiting people to fight a war is ridiculous. Myanmar people, including those from disadvantaged communities, have agencies of their own. Myanmar people made the overwhelming choice to continue to fight against the junta even if it costs them dearly.

Why do they keep fighting? Because they know that there is little to no choice unless they want to live under the Tatmadaw's boots for the rest of their lives. The junta has not fundamentally changed and is still the same brutal, irrational actor it has been for over 60 years. As long as they continue to rule, the health and education systems will continue to be neglected. Ethnic minorities will continue to be subject to the same oppression they have been for decades and continue to experience horrors like extrajudicial killings, their villages being burnt down and mass rape. Tens of thousands of people are likely to die of otherwise preventable diseases. Horrors like Hurricane Nargis or the recent COVID wave will continue to devastate the country under the military's mismanagement. The military will still kidnap, imprison, torture and kill political dissidents. Countless people will still die regardless of whether people choose to take up arms or not. 

Also, I am not even sure why you bother to bring up Aung San Suu Kyi. It is irrelevant whether or not she would support the declaration of war or armed uprising in general. She has been imprisoned for over seven months and can barely communicate with the country at large under these circumstances. It does not really help that Aung San Suu Kyi's strategy of non-violence clearly has not worked to uproot the military as a political institution in the country anyways. It is pretty clear that it is the Myanmar public at large that chose to rise up against the military regime. Is it an uphill battle? Yes, and people do know that.
