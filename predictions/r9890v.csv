Nothing I say is gonna make you NLD worshippers say otherwise.  A person's belief is very hard to shake after all.

You are always going to believe that NLD is the Pure Saint and the Army is the bad guys.  So, I'm not gonna argue with you anymore.  Just so you know, I also think the Army is full of shit.

P.S. The evidence of the election fraud, where many people who don't even have National Registration Card (NRC) and yet are allowed to vote to raise the number of votes in favor of NLD, will soon come out.

Anyways, have a nice day.  It's been fun trying to figure out how hardcoded you denial actually is.  Remember, I also think the Army is shit.  So, I would appreciate it if you don't go around lying to others that I'm spreading Army propaganda.",0,6,1639637048.0,PomegranateSpare5761,negative,negative,negative
t1_hor2jva,hor5zur,"Because you are still repeating what army had produced in their state media despite election fraud claim has been debunked by third party independent watchers and observers. 

You are truly naive if you think that NLD have no chance of landslide win. But historically NLD had always won more than 80% of the seat. In 1990, 2012 by-election, 2015 general election. So why you think NLD needs to cheat. Not logical. Why you think general population protested against the coup?

Lol, just point me out where I claim NLD is the pure saint. I just presenting you with the facts. Please debunk my claims if it's not true instead of being childish.

If you think army is shit then stop repeating their lies here you knuckles head. Otherwise I am pointing out (not lying) that you are spreading army propaganda. Where you heard those accusations seriously? From the people you hang out with? Your dad? Just here say? Tell me are you comfortably living in gated community in Yangon? SMH.

Facts and logic are not your forte I can see.",1,7,1639639479.0,tharju,negative,negative,negative
t1_hor2jva,hor70et,"I still can't help at laughing at your comment about ""I don't support army shit too""! 

But yeah you agree with army claimed of voters fraud and NLD being a cheater. So you figure there is a justification for a coup. And yet you don't support army shit!?

So do you see how you sound like an oxymoron?",1,7,1639640233.0,tharju,negative,negative,negative

t1_hpn4vpb,hpn5z3m,Oh I know I am soooo right against that person. We were not arguing about ideas or debating..I was just pointing out his made up bullshit he got from MRTV or MWD or probably from his surroundings.

t1_hpnn6t8,hpnnr6l,"Pointing out the lies is showing the attitude now? SAC and the army never have people support. Army can oppress the people but as soon as people got the chance they are always against the army. Just look at all the last elections. Lol. 

You can come back a year later or we will fail..it doesn't matter. It just that you can not defend the SAC action logically, rationally and reasonably. Come on kiddo just admit it. LMAO. :"")",1,2,1640243383.0,tharju,negative,negative,negative

this is the mindset deeply deluded in the army members that somehow they have people support for some reason and with some miracle they can have 50% of the seats over all. Chee brain Shit brain.",1,2,1640246257.0,tharju,negative,negative,negative
