8 countries including China and Russia are sending their delegates to said military parade. Russia role seems to be more prominent as they send in a deputy defense minister, and also explicitly voiced support for the Junta, while China is still being careful on maintaining their vague position and interest.

So yeah, even if China caved in to the pressure and agree to the UN resolution, it will be futile because Russia is still there.

Also, regarding the veto use, China's excuse is they always oppose any intervention policy and support sovereignty more. I haven't read much on China (and Russia)'s veto use yet, but there are many free research journals if you want to read more on that.

Just from simple google search, i already found these 3. If you put a little more time in it, i'm sure you will found more study cases and analysis that is more relevant to current situation.
